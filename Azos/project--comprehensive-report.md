## Key Projects & Technology Focus

### Core Technology Platform
Azos is an over-collateralized stablecoin protocol that dampens collateral volatility, unlocks latent liquidity and produces stable assets. It is a foundational decentralized finance primitive for establishing new markets and enabling infinite impact innovation.

### Algorithmic Market Operations (AMO)
The big unlock of Azos is the addition of algorithmic market operation (AMO) modules which were originally invented by Frax. Our first prototype of an AMO is called the Stability Module. Azos is the first platform based on the Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) and Gödel, Escher and Bach (GEB) platforms to utilize AMOs to enhance stability, revenue generation and scalability.

### Impact Asset Integration
Azos is 100% backed by impact assets. We use our impact and financial analysis frameworks to assess assets before accepting them as collateral.
