# AZOS Finance - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Information

**Token Name**: AZUSD (also referenced as ZAI in technical documentation)  
**Token Type**: Stablecoin  
**Token Utility**: Backbone of digital regenerative economy enabling participation in impact-positive transactions  
**Backing**: 100% backed by tokenized impact assets

## Blockchain Infrastructure

**Primary Blockchain**: Optimism (Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution)  
**Testnet**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet for development and testing  
**Protocol Architecture**: Third-generation decentralized stablecoin platform

### Technical Implementation
- **Smart Contract Foundation**: Built on open-source codebase derived from MakerDAO, Reflexer Finance, and HAI On Optimism
- **Protocol Type**: Over-collateralized stablecoin protocol with algorithmic market operations
- **GitHub Repository**: Active open-source development with complete contract deployments available

## Smart Contracts & DeFi Mechanisms

### Core Protocol Features
**Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)**:
- Users can deposit impact assets as collateral
- Generate AZUSD stablecoin against locked collateral
- Over-collateralization ensures protocol stability

**Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs)**:
- First implementation of AMO modules on Multi-Collateral Dai and GEB platforms
- Stability Module prototype for supply expansion and contraction
- Automated price stability mechanisms

### Smart Contract Architecture
**Core Modules Include**:
- Collateral management systems
- Stablecoin issuance mechanisms  
- Governance protocols
- Global settlement procedures
- Stability and scalability enhancements

## ReFi Mechanics & Tokenomics

### Economic Model
**Collateral Requirements**: Over-collateralized system requiring more value in impact assets than AZUSD issued
**Revenue Generation**: Fee structures from CDP creation and AMO operations
**Stability Mechanisms**: Algorithmic supply adjustments to maintain AZUSD price stability

### Impact Asset Integration
**Accepted Collateral Types** (based on demo environment):
- **Base Carbon Tonne (BCT)**: Tokenized carbon credits
- **Fungible Green Bond (FGB)**: Tokenized green bonds
- **Renewables Energy Index (REI)**: Tokenized renewable energy investments

### Governance Structure
**Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making for protocol parameters
**Open Development**: Modular base allowing other developers to build and expand
**Cooperative Principles**: Emphasis on collaboration rather than competition

## Monitoring, Reporting & Verification (MRV)

### Digital Asset Verification
**Blockchain Recording**: All impact asset data and transactions recorded immutably on blockchain
**Metadata Integration**: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) data stored as metadata within tokens
**Real-time Tracking**: 24/7 availability for asset verification and trading

### Impact Assessment Framework
**Asset Evaluation**: Proprietary impact and financial analysis frameworks assess assets before acceptance as collateral
**Transparency**: All collateral backing visible on blockchain
**Compliance**: Automated compliance tracking with environmental standards
