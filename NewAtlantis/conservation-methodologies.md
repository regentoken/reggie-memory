# NewAtlantis - Conservation Methodologies

## Marine Ecosystem Restoration Strategies

### Plankton-Focused Conservation
NewAtlantis employs a foundational approach by focusing on planktonic ecosystems, recognizing that plankton represents approximately 90% of marine biomass and forms the base of all marine food webs. This bottom-up conservation strategy ensures that interventions address the fundamental building blocks of ocean health.

The platform provides MPAs with data-driven tools to improve conservation effectiveness through:
- **Baseline Establishment**: Comprehensive biodiversity assessment before conservation interventions
- **Outcome Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of conservation impact using genetic and ecological indicators
- **Adaptive Management**: Real-time adjustment of conservation strategies based on ecosystem response
- **Evidence-based Expansion**: Data-driven identification of priority areas for MPA expansion
