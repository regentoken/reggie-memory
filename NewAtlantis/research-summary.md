# NewAtlantis - Research Summary

## Project Overview

NewAtlantis Labs is pioneering the first marine-only, AI-native platform that transforms raw oceanic data into revenue-generating products for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The project combines advanced metagenomics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to create sustainable funding mechanisms for ocean conservation while making marine biodiversity an investable asset class.

## Key Findings Summary
