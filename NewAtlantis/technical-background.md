# NewAtlantis - Technical Background

## Scientific & Environmental Basis

### Marine Ecosystem Crisis
NewAtlantis addresses the critical challenge of marine biodiversity loss and inadequate ocean protection. Currently, the world needs to scale Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) by approximately 13x over the next 8 years to meet the 30% ocean protection target by 2030. This represents one of the most urgent conservation challenges facing humanity.

### Planktonic Foundation Science
The platform focuses on plankton as the fundamental building block of marine ecosystems, recognizing that plankton accounts for approximately 90% of marine biomass. While seemingly inconsequential, plankton forms the foundation of the global food web, making planktonic ecosystem health mission-critical for ocean regeneration.

### Metagenomics Foundation
Ocean metagenomics provides the scientific foundation for the platform by analyzing DNA sequences directly from marine water samples to identify and quantify microorganisms present in marine environments. This approach enables comprehensive ecosystem assessment without requiring cultivation of individual species.

## Problem Urgency & Scale

### Conservation Funding Crisis
MPAs overwhelmingly lack adequate resources to protect marine life due to reliance on precarious government funding and traditional philanthropy. This funding gap prevents effective implementation of conservation measures and limits the expansion of protected areas to necessary scales.

### Climate Change Acceleration
Marine ecosystems face unprecedented pressure from climate change, including ocean acidification, warming temperatures, rising sea levels, and changing current patterns. These changes threaten the stability of global food webs and carbon sequestration capacity.

### Biodiversity Loss Timeline
Current rates of marine biodiversity loss threaten ecosystem collapse within decades. The twin existential crises of climate change and biodiversity loss require immediate, scalable intervention to prevent irreversible damage to marine systems.

## Climate-Related Risks & Financial Impact

### Ocean Carbon Sequestration
Marine ecosystems play a critical role in global carbon cycling, with oceans absorbing approximately 25% of human-generated carbon emissions and 90% of excess heat. Degraded marine ecosystems reduce this vital climate regulation capacity.

### Economic Dependency
Global economies depend heavily on marine ecosystem services, including fisheries, coastal protection, tourism, and climate regulation. Marine ecosystem degradation threatens multi-trillion-dollar economic sectors and coastal communities worldwide.

### Insurance and Risk Assessment
Traditional risk assessment models inadequately account for marine ecosystem health, creating systemic financial risks. Improved biodiversity monitoring and forecasting can enhance risk assessment and enable more accurate insurance pricing.
