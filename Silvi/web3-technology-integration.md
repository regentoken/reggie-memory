# Silvi Protocol - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Status

**Token:** Planned but not yet launched  
**Current Status:** The project aims to operate via a DAO structure after launching a token, but no specific token details have been announced publicly.

## Blockchain Integration

### Primary Blockchain
**Blockchain Used:** Multi-chain approach with focus on sustainability
- Integration with **Ethereum** blockchain for tree registration and tracking
- Plans for **Hedera** integration for agroforestry methodologies using Guardian infrastructure
- **Polygon** blockchain mentioned for certain integrations
- Focus on **proof-of-stake** blockchains to minimize energy consumption

### Technical Infrastructure
- **IPFS Integration**: Utilizes InterPlanetary File System for decentralized data storage
- **Filecoin Network**: Partnership with Protocol Labs/Filecoin for decentralized storage solutions
- **CO2.Storage**: Integration with CO2.Storage for open ecological asset data schemas

## Smart Contracts and dMRV Technology

### TreeForward Bonds
TreeForwards are distinct bonds implemented as smart contracts that provide financial commitment to plant and steward trees through maturity. Each TreeForward:
- Prescribes species and location-specific methodologies
- Releases milestone-based rewards automatically
- Collateralizes the net present value of new trees
- Implements performance-based payouts dependent on verifiable milestones

### Batch Accounting System
Robust smart contract system for managing groupings of TreeForwards, ensuring:
- Each tree within a batch receives requisite funding and care
- Scalable management for large-scale reforestation initiatives
- Area-based accounting for pre-planting propagation and logistics
- Automated distribution of payments based on verified milestones

### Digital MRV (dMRV) Integration
Silvi's cutting-edge decentralized Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) technology includes:
- **Genesis Claims**: Created through combination of phone and drone ground-truth technology
- **On-chain Verification**: Tree data and metadata stored immutably on blockchain
- **Automated Auditing**: Smart contracts for randomization and verification optimization
- **Reputation Systems**: Integration with decentralized identity protocols

## ReFi Mechanics and Tokenomics

### Planned Economic Model
While specific tokenomics haven't been released, the planned model includes:
- **Governance Token**: Future DAO governance through token-based voting
- **Staking Mechanisms**: Performance-based rewards for tree stewards
- **Natural Capital Backing**: Trees positioned as foundational asset class for token value
- **Community Incentives**: 25% of Gitcoin grant funds allocated to community reforestation projects

### Reward Distribution
- **TreeForward Payments**: Milestone-based compensation for verified tree care
- **Performance Bonuses**: Additional rewards for exceptional stewardship
- **Community Rewards**: Incentives for onboarding new stewards and projects

## Decentralized Identity and Data Registries

### Identity Integration
- **Eco Labs Partnership**: Collaboration on reputation and ID protocol integration
- **Steward Profiles**: On-chain profiles for tree stewards with performance tracking
- **Community Verification**: Peer-to-peer verification systems for stewardship claims

### Data Management
- **Open Data Standards**: Commitment to open-source ecological data schemas
- **Interoperable Registries**: Integration with multiple ecological data registries
- **Provenance Tracking**: Complete chain of custody for tree data from planting to maturity

## Partnerships with ReFi and DeSci Projects

### Core ReFi Ecosystem
- **ReFi DAO**: Active participant and collaborator in global ReFi initiatives
- **dMeter**: Partnership for dMRV technology development and implementation
- **Regen Network**: Integration with EcoCredit module and Data Module
- **Hypercerts**: Collaboration on impact certificates and retroactive funding models

### Technical Collaborations
- **Athena Protocol**: Ocean Protocol middleware-like provider integration
- **Sunflower Ecotech**: Adaptive agroforestry methodology development
- **Open Forest Protocol**: Collaboration on forest monitoring and verification
- **Climate Collective**: Grant recipient for reforestation pilots and steward payouts

### DeSci Connections
- **FarmOS Integration**: Open-source farm management platform integration
- **Protocol Labs**: Filecoin Green hackathon winner for sustainable blockchain solutions
- **Guardian Platform**: Hedera-based infrastructure for environmental monitoring

## Implementation Roadmap

### Current Status (Live/Beta)
- **Silvi App**: Public beta available for tree registration and monitoring
- **dMRV System**: Live for vetted projects with methodology configurations
- **Community Onboarding**: 18 Web3 projects onboarded through Operation WebTree
- **Kenya Pilots**: 70,000 trees propagated across 15 sites

### Near-term Development (6-12 months)
- **Token Launch**: Governance token deployment for DAO formation
- **Advanced MRV**: Enhanced satellite and IoT integration
- **Cross-chain Integration**: Multi-blockchain deployment for global accessibility
- **Methodology Expansion**: Additional species and region-specific protocols

### Long-term Vision (1-3 years)
- **Full DAO Transition**: Complete decentralization of governance and operations
- **100M Stewards**: Platform capable of supporting 100 million tree stewards
- **Global Standards**: Establishment of industry standards for tree-based natural capital
- **Financial Integration**: Integration with traditional finance for mainstream adoption

## Measurement and Verification Technology

### Multi-Modal Verification
- **Human Sensing**: Smartphone-based data collection by stewards
- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite and IoT sensor integration
- **Reputation Sensing**: Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials
- **AI Verification**: Machine learning for automated tree species identification

### Data Integration
- **Geospatial Data**: GPS coordinates and polygon mapping
- **Temporal Tracking**: Growth monitoring over time periods
- **Species Information**: Detailed botanical and ecological data
- **Environmental Context**: Soil, climate, and ecosystem health metrics
