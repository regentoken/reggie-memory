# Silvi Protocol - Conservation Methodologies

## Field Techniques and Approaches

### Indigenous Tree Stewardship
Silvi emphasizes indigenous tree stewardship as a core methodology, recognizing that there are 70,000 tree species around the world, while current propagation and nursery systems are limited to a few commercial tree products. The protocol focuses on scaling up indigenous native tree stewardship through:

- **Species-specific protocols**: Detailed methodologies for different native tree species
- **Climate adaptation**: Selection of trees adapted to local climate conditions
- **Ecological optimization**: Focus on trees that provide maximum ecosystem benefits

### Participatory Stewardship Model
The protocol implements a participatory model that empowers community members to run independent nurseries, increasing capacity and coordination for reforestation efforts. This approach includes:

- **Community-driven nurseries**: Supporting local communities in establishing and operating tree nurseries
- **Collaborative stewardship**: Multiple stewards working together on reforestation zones
- **Peer-to-peer verification**: Community members verifying each other's work

## Restoration Strategies

### Agroforestry Integration
Silvi collaborates with Sunflower Ecotech to develop adaptive agroforestry methodologies that integrate tree planting with agricultural practices:

- **Syntropic Agroforestry**: Implementation of syntropic systems that regenerate bare land into thriving food forests
- **Smallholder Focus**: Methodologies specifically designed for smallholder farmers
- **Multi-species Integration**: Combining trees with complementary crops and agricultural systems

### Ecosystem Regeneration
The protocol takes a holistic approach to ecosystem regeneration rather than simple tree planting:

- **Food Forest Development**: Creating diverse food forests that support both ecological and human needs
- **Biodiversity Enhancement**: Focus on native species that support local wildlife and ecosystems
- **Soil Health**: Integration with soil restoration and health improvement practices

### Landscape-Scale Restoration
- **Watershed Management**: Consideration of trees' role in water cycle regulation
- **Corridor Creation**: Connecting fragmented forest areas through strategic tree planting
- **Climate Resilience**: Building forest systems that can adapt to changing climate conditions

## Role of Local Communities

### Community Empowerment
Silvi's theory of change recognizes that reforestation requires community effects to scale effectively:

- **Local Leadership**: Supporting community leaders like Eliud, a former primary teacher turned reforestation champion near Kakamega forest
- **Capacity Building**: Training community members in tree propagation and stewardship techniques
- **Economic Empowerment**: Providing sustainable livelihoods through tree-based economic activities

### Training and Education
- **Technical Training**: Education on proper tree planting, care, and monitoring techniques
- **Financial Literacy**: Training on how to participate in natural capital markets
- **Technology Adoption**: Helping communities learn to use the Silvi App and dMRV systems

### Co-creation Approach
- **Methodology Development**: Working with communities to develop locally appropriate methodologies
- **Cultural Integration**: Respecting and incorporating local cultural practices related to forestry
- **Adaptive Management**: Continuously improving approaches based on community feedback

## Traditional Knowledge and Indigenous Practices

### Integration of Traditional Wisdom
- **Indigenous Species Knowledge**: Learning from local communities about native tree species and their uses
- **Traditional Planting Methods**: Incorporating time-tested traditional planting and care techniques
- **Seasonal Awareness**: Utilizing traditional knowledge about optimal planting times and conditions

### Cultural Preservation
- **Language Documentation**: Recording local names and cultural significance of tree species
- **Practice Documentation**: Preserving traditional forest management practices
- **Intergenerational Transfer**: Supporting the transfer of knowledge from elders to younger generations

## Data Collection and Monitoring Frameworks

### Multi-Modal Monitoring
Silvi implements a comprehensive monitoring framework that combines multiple data collection methods:

#### Human-Sensing (Smartphone-based)
- **Steward Reporting**: Regular updates from tree stewards using the Silvi App
- **Photo Documentation**: Visual tracking of tree growth and health over time
- **GPS Coordination**: Precise location tracking for each tree and reforestation zone
- **Species Documentation**: Detailed records of tree species, planting dates, and care activities

#### Remote Sensing (IoT & Satellite)
- **Satellite Monitoring**: Regular satellite imagery analysis for landscape-scale monitoring
- **IoT Integration**: Environmental sensors for soil moisture, temperature, and other conditions
- **Drone Surveys**: Aerial monitoring for detailed area assessments
- **Growth Trajectory Analysis**: Automated analysis of tree growth patterns over time

#### Reputation Sensing (DIDs & VCs)
- **Steward Verification**: Decentralized identity systems for verifying steward credentials
- **Performance Tracking**: On-chain records of steward performance and reliability
- **Community Validation**: Peer verification systems for quality assurance

### Open Data Standards
- **CO2.Storage Integration**: Using open ecological asset data schemas for interoperability
- **FarmOS Integration**: Integration with open-source farm management platform
- **Standardized Reporting**: Following established protocols for ecological impact reporting

## Impact Metrics and Verification

### Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF)
Partnership with the Lexicon to use the Ecological Benefits Framework for comprehensive impact communication:

- **Carbon Sequestration**: Measurement of CO2 absorption and storage
- **Biodiversity Impact**: Assessment of habitat creation and species diversity
- **Water Cycle Benefits**: Evaluation of water retention and watershed protection
- **Soil Health**: Monitoring of soil improvement and erosion prevention
- **Air Quality**: Assessment of air purification and pollution reduction
- **Social Equity**: Measurement of community benefits and empowerment

### Performance-Based Verification
- **Milestone Tracking**: Regular assessment of tree survival and growth milestones
- **Quality Metrics**: Evaluation of tree health, growth rate, and ecosystem integration
- **Long-term Monitoring**: Multi-year tracking to ensure long-term success
- **Adaptive Management**: Continuous improvement based on performance data

### Financial Impact Measurement
- **Natural Capital Valuation**: Quantification of ecosystem services provided by trees
- **Community Economic Impact**: Assessment of livelihood improvements for stewards
- **Return on Investment**: Analysis of financial returns from reforestation investments
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Comparison of different approaches and their relative efficiency

## Open Source Tools and Methodologies
