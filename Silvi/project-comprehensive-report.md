# Silvi Protocol - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

Silvi Protocol's mission is to contribute to the trillion tree target by building financial and coordination tools for ecologically optimized and climate-adapted reforestation. Their fundamental vision is based on the company motto: "how do we enable 100 million people to make a living planting 1 trillion trees?"

The organization aims to catalyze a network for anyone who plants trees to spark ecological regeneration by developing reforestation capabilities in local communities and connecting social, ecological, and economic systems. Silvi isn't just a company; it's a movement dedicated to accelerating global reforestation and providing sustainable livelihoods for millions, sowing seeds of hope and healing for our planet.

## Legal/Organizational Structure

Silvi operates as a protocol-based organization with plans for decentralization. The project aims to operate this portfolio via a DAO structure after launching a token. Currently, it functions as a startup with a structured team approach to building the protocol infrastructure.

## Founders, Leadership, and Team

**Founder & CEO:** Djimo Serodio - Environmental scientist and agricultural technology entrepreneur who previously founded Justlearn, a company crafting modular K-12 curricula dedicated to teaching aquaponics and sustainable farming methods to children in classrooms. As founder Djimo Serodio began to explore a module for tree planting, he realized there was room for a new platform to grow, one dedicated to reforestation around the world.

The team collaborates extensively with partners in the ReFi ecosystem including dMeter, Regen Network, Filecoin, Hypercerts, and ReFi DAO.

## Key Projects and Sites of Work

### Primary Operations
- **Kakamega Forest, Kenya**: Our largest project is in Kakamega Forest, which is in close conversation with the Forestry services and the Forest-run nurseries. After 8 months, Silvi's network of early adopters have propagated ~70,000 trees across 15 pilot sites in Kenya around the Kakamega Forest.

### Global Network
- **Operation WebTree**: In GG 19, we pledged 25% of our Gitcoin grant to launch #OperationWebTree, a global reforestation movement powered by Web3. We are proud to report back that we have onboarded 18 projects by working closely with web3 and ReFi communities around the world including Greenpill Chapters, ReFi DAO Local Nodes, and independent regenerative projects like AgroforestDAO, Kokonut Network and Ekonavi.

- **International Collaborations**: Communities from Miami, Florida to Kakamega, Kenya are using Silvi to track their reforestation progress and tap the financial benefits of creating natural capital.

## Notable Media Mentions and Partnerships

- **ReFi Week**: Silvi was a major sponsor and participant in ReFi Week with over 40 participants embarking on a monumental project with the goal of helping plant 1000 trees at TDF. Sponsored by Silvi, this effort was an experiment in holistically regenerating an ecosystem.

- **ReFi Generation Podcast**: Featured in Episode 9 of ReFi Generation podcast with founder Djimo Serodio sharing insights about global reforestation efforts and blockchain technology integration.
