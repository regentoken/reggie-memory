# GoodDollar - Conservation Methodologies

## Economic Justice and Anti-Poverty Strategies

### Financial Inclusion Methodologies

**Universal Access Design**: Available to anyone with a cell phone and internet access, dramatically lowering barriers to financial participation.

**Targeted Distribution**: GoodDollar has kept the value of daily distributed G$ purposely low so that the majority of funds are available for people in less stable economies.

**Economic Incentive Alignment**: People earning income in stronger economies are disincentivized from filing claims, naturally directing resources to areas of greatest need.

**Daily Basic Income**: People get paid each time they claim UBI, and can claim once every 24 hours, providing consistent economic support.

**Microeconomic Empowerment**: Microentrepreneurs all over the world are using G$ to buy and sell products and services, such as airtime or professional services.

**Economic Stability**: Building the token based on holding U.S. dollar-pegged stable coins in reserve provides cryptocurrency with limited volatility for economically vulnerable populations.
