## Tokenomics and Economic Model

### Reserve-Backed Stability Model

**Stability Mechanism**: Building the token based on holding U.S. dollar-pegged stable coins in reserve gives people all over the world the ability to claim cryptocurrency with limited volatility.

**Value Generation**: The capital behind each GoodDollar is generated from interest earned on crypto or by staking crypto through protocols such as MakerDAO or upcoming platforms such as ETH 2.0.

**Economic Distribution**: Value of daily distributed G$ purposely kept low so majority of funds are available for people in less stable economies.

### Three Token Acquisition Methods

**1. Claiming (UBI Distribution)**:
- Daily UBI claims for verified users
- Requires unique identity verification
- 24-hour claiming cycle
- Targeted at financially underserved populations

**2. Earning (Economic Activity)**:
- Marketplace transactions for goods and services
- Professional services payment
- Microentrepreneur activities
- Community-based commerce

**3. Buying (Direct Purchase)**:
- Direct purchase on supported blockchain networks
- Available on Ethereum, Celo, and Fuse
- Integration with GoodDollar Reserve for liquidity

### Sustainable Funding Model

**Interest-Based Generation**: All users can stake capital in third-party protocols such as Compound or Aave via the GoodDollar Trust, earning market-rate liquidity rewards while supporting UBI generation.

**Yield Farming for Good**: Leverages yield farming and liquidity mining rewards to encourage capital flow toward protocol.
