## Strategic Focus Areas

### Universal Basic Income Innovation
**UBI Implementation**: Every person gets some kind of monthly income, irrelevant to their work or educational status, delivered through blockchain technology

**Global Accessibility**: Challenge assumption that UBI models can only be launched nationally - GoodDollar works beyond government boundaries

**Daily Distribution**: People get paid each time they claim UBI, and can claim once every 24 hours

### Financial Inclusion Strategy
**Target Population**: 1.7 billion unbanked and 5.5 billion underbanked globally

**Low Barrier Entry**: Digital wallet with simple onboarding process that allows sign-ins through Facebook or Google accounts

**Economic Empowerment**: Microentrepreneurs all over the world are using G$ to buy and sell products and services, such as airtime or professional services

### Anti-Poverty Protocol Design
**Purposeful Distribution**: GoodDollar has kept the value of daily distributed G$ purposely low so that the majority of funds are available for people in less stable economies

**Economic Incentives**: People earning income in stronger economies are disincentivized from filing claims

**Stable Value**: Building the token based on holding U.S. dollar-pegged stable coins in reserve gives people all over the world the ability to claim cryptocurrency with limited volatility

## Community and Economic Impact

### User Engagement
**Active Community**: Global community of 100,000 people buying and selling digital and physical goods and services in G$

**Marketplace Activity**: Several different existing marketplaces where users can spend G$ tokens

**Social Impact**: You can donate your G$ to one of the many non-profits and NGOs around the world that accept GoodDollars to support their activities

### Economic Ecosystem
**Three Acquisition Methods**: Claiming (daily UBI), earning (marketplace activity), and buying (direct purchase)

**Value Creation**: The initial value of GoodDollars will either be created by people buying and selling goods/services for GoodDollars or by people voluntarily staking assets for the purpose of improving equality in the world

**Network Effects**: In order for GoodDollar's coins to obtain value, a network effect is needed to enforce the usability of the currency

## Innovation in Social Finance

### DeFi Integration
**Yield Farming for Good**: All users can stake capital in third-party protocols such as Compound or Aave via the GoodDollar Trust, earning market-rate liquidity rewards while supporting UBI generation

**Permissionless Funding**: Due to blockchain's open infrastructure and the composable nature of DeFi, any individual or corporation can transparently and permissionlessly fund the GoodDollar UBI system

**Reserve System**: GoodDollar members can buy and sell G$ directly inside the GoodDollar Reserve, enabling the economy to grow and thrive

### Corporate Social Responsibility Innovation
**New Philanthropy Model**: Challenges traditional models of corporate giving and philanthropic capital through transparent, permissionless funding mechanisms

**Social Investing**: Uses principles of social investing and free market forces to create sustainable UBI funding

**Impact Measurement**: Transparency of blockchain creates an open database cataloging the impacts and effects of UBI for policy research
