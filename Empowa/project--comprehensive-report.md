# Empowa - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

Empowa is a pioneering RealFi (Real Finance) platform that leverages blockchain technology to address Africa's housing crisis through decentralized financing solutions. The company's mission centers on enabling 1 million African families to become owners of climate-smart homes by 2030, fundamentally transforming how affordable housing is financed across the continent.

**Core Mission**: To build a decentralized funding platform for affordable housing in Africa, unlocking the potential of the under-served mortgage market through innovative Web3 technology.

**Vision Statement**: To create prosperity through property by providing decentralized end-user finance that enables the building of affordable and greener houses across Africa, addressing the continent's 50 million home shortage while promoting environmental sustainability.

## Legal & Organizational Structure

**Business Model**: Empowa operates as a technology platform rather than a traditional property developer, focusing on providing the software infrastructure and financing mechanisms needed to unlock Africa's affordable housing market.

**Organizational Approach**:
- Platform-based business model connecting investors, developers, and homebuyers
- Partnership-driven structure working with local property developers
- Technology-first approach providing software solutions for the entire housing value chain
- Decentralized financing mechanisms reducing dependence on traditional banking systems

**Legal Framework**:
- Built on Cardano blockchain infrastructure
- Operates through smart contracts for transparent and automated processes
- Partnership agreements with local developers and financial institutions
- Compliance with regional housing and financial regulations

## Founders, Leadership & Team

**Glen Jordan - Founder & CEO**
Glen Jordan witnessed first-hand the crippling effects of African housing challenges on lower- and middle-class citizens while running a fintech startup (IMB Financial Services) that catered to Zimbabweans who migrated to South Africa during their country's economic crisis. Through building the fintech company, Jordan was exposed to the realities of wealth creation in Africa and recognized the systemic failures in financial infrastructure.

**Background & Experience**:
- Extensive experience in African fintech and financial services
- Deep understanding of the challenges faced by financially excluded populations
- Recognition of blockchain technology's potential for addressing structural economic issues
- Focus on building systems designed for African markets rather than adapting Western models

**Leadership Philosophy**: "Very few people in developed countries understand how the existing financial systems are designed for their societies and how they are not fit for purpose in the developing world. We need to design financial products and systems that meet the needs of our societies but maintain the financial reporting and discipline that capital require. We need to build systems from the bottom-up."
