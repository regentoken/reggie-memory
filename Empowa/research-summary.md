# Empowa - Research Summary

## High-Level Project Overview

Empowa represents a groundbreaking implementation of Real Finance (RealFi) technology, leveraging Cardano blockchain infrastructure to address Africa's critical housing shortage through innovative decentralized financing mechanisms. Founded by Glen Jordan in 2020, the platform has successfully demonstrated that blockchain technology can solve real-world problems by providing affordable, climate-smart housing to previously excluded populations across Africa.

The project operates as a technology platform rather than a traditional property developer, focusing on providing the software infrastructure and financing mechanisms needed to unlock Africa's $1 trillion affordable housing opportunity. With a mission to enable 1 million African families to own climate-smart homes by 2030, Empowa has already proven its model in Mozambique and is expanding across the continent.

## Key Findings Summary

**Market Transformation**: Empowa has demonstrated the ability to significantly impact housing markets, increasing Mozambique's home loan market by 5% with just 30 homes and reducing the average homeowner age by 20 years.

**Financial Innovation**: The platform successfully accommodates informal economy income patterns (85% of African income) through flexible payment systems and community-based verification, addressing the primary barrier to homeownership across Africa.

**Technology Integration**: Built on Cardano blockchain, Empowa leverages proof-of-stake consensus for environmental sustainability while providing the scalability needed for continental expansion.

**Real World Impact**: Quantified outcomes include 129 lives improved, 155 jobs created, 50 women-led households supported, and 100% climate-resilient housing delivered.

**Investment Success**: Raised $3.75 million through token sales and established partnerships with major institutions including the Nairobi Securities Exchange.
