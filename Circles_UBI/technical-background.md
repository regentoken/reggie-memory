# Circles UBI - Technical Background

## Scientific and Social Economic Basis

### Universal Basic Income Theory

**Academic Foundation**: According to the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), basic income is a periodic money payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement.

**Five Core Characteristics**: UBI implementation through blockchain technology addresses fundamental characteristics of unconditional income distribution at scale.

**Cross-Cultural Appeal**: Universal Basic Income is one of the most cross-culturally appealing political movements of the modern era. It has attracted the support of thinkers from every background including Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr, Stephen Hawking, Guy Standing, Milton Friedman, and David Graeber.

### Community Currency Systems (CCS)

**Economic Theory**: Circles UBI shares affinities with a community currency system, similar to existing projects like Real Economy Currency (REC) in Barcelona or Mumbuca in Brazil. Yet, none of these projects leverages blockchain and smart contracts to automate and decentralize the system.

**Local Economic Empowerment**: These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local.

**Household Economics**: We prefer to think of economies in the original sense of households, not defined by four walls but by the relations that reproduce them. In this sense, self-sustainability is achieved through localised interdependence between actors, who complement each other by providing the labor and resources that they need to live.

## Urgency and Scale of the Problem

### Wealth Inequality Crisis

**Growing Inequality**: The topic of UBI has exploded in popularity in recent years, as wealth inequality grows and inflation-adjusted wages fall all across the world.

**Systemic Economic Issues**: Key problems of current societies such as gaping inequalities and climate change require new approaches to economic organization.

**Democratic Erosion**: Current economic systems threaten democratic institutions through concentration of wealth and power.

### Implementation Barriers

**Government Limitations**: Public support for the idea of UBI has never been higher, but plans for implementation are progressing slowly and without cooperation at the international scale.

**Scale Challenges**: UBI systems have received a "too big to implement" label at the highest levels of government, similar to climate change action, making direct government implementation difficult.

**Bureaucratic Inefficiency**: Traditional UBI proposals face significant bureaucratic and administrative challenges that blockchain technology could potentially address.

## Economic Risks and Financial Impact

### Traditional Financial System Limitations

**Gatekeepers and Roadblocks**: Starting with Bitcoin and moving on to smart contract platforms like Ethereum, blockchain technology has achieved widespread popularity by routing around the gatekeepers and roadblocks that make innovation so difficult in the legacy financial system.

**Centralized Control**: Current financial systems concentrate power in institutions rather than enabling democratic participation in monetary policy.

**Exclusion Mechanisms**: Traditional banking and financial services exclude significant portions of the global population from economic participation.

### Monetary Theory Implications

**Commodity vs. Sovereign Money**: We can, in general, classify two main theories of money: the commodity theory of money and the sovereign theory of money.

**Democratic Money Creation**: The decentralization of the production of money, claimed by people directly as a universal income through infrastructures like Circles, forms the basis of a democratic economy.

**Post-Capitalist Economics**: Focus on creating economic systems that regenerate commons rather than extract from them.

## Technical Papers, Data, and Evidence

### Academic Research

**Frontiers in Blockchain Study** (March 2024): "Universal basic income on blockchain: the case of circles UBI" - Comprehensive analysis of implementation challenges and outcomes.

**ArXiv Publication** (2024): "Impact of a Blockchain-based Universal Basic Income Pilot: The case of Circles UBI currency" - First qualitative study of blockchain-based UBI implementation.

**ACM Conference Paper** (2023): "Universal Basic Income in a Blockchain-Based Community Currency" - Technical analysis of network effects and user behavior.

### Empirical Evidence from Berlin Pilot

**Survey Data**: Research conducted between October and November 2023 with twenty-five individuals involved in various ways in the Circles' network.

**User Motivation Analysis**: Their participation was deeply motivated by their identification with the values and ideals of the Circles community.

**Economic Impact**: Some stories of economic linkages that suggest a positive externality in adopting a local community currency.

### Network Analysis

**Structural Changes**: Analysis of structural changes in the network, especially in relation to a subsidy program, involving local businesses.

**Centrality Measures**: Identification of prominent users based on centrality measures, and investigation of how the UBI was effectively spent.

**Causal Fidelity Analysis**: Method agnostic to the economic context to identify optimal aggregation windows for the temporal network of CCS transactions based on the Causal Fidelity (CF) index.

## Social and Political Framework

### Democratic Confederalism

**Organizational Principle**: Democratic Confederalism starts from the notion that every entity has the right to organise itself from the local to the universal.

**Decentralized Governance**: Circles aims at the decentralization of economic and political power via democratic and autonomous practices.

**Bottom-up Organization**: System designed to be bootstrapped in a completely organic and grassroots fashion.

### Open Cooperativism Model

**Counter-Hegemonic Strategy**: The model of open cooperativism as a counter-hegemonic political project vis-Ã -vis neoliberalism.

**Commons Regeneration**: The model of open cooperativism induces a transvestment of capital into the regeneration of the commons, thereby resulting in the distribution and redistribution of profits, income, and rents.

**Systemic Transformation**: The model of open cooperativism forces capitalism to adapt to post-capitalism in the long run.

## Implementation Challenges and Lessons

### Financial Sustainability

**Resource Limitations**: Due to financial limitations, our operations cease as of January 2024.

**Sustainability Gap**: Research suggests the need to identify methods to ensure sustainability of self-organised CCSs adopting a UBI issuance scheme.

**Funding Models**: Traditional funding approaches may not align with decentralized, community-owned economic systems.

### Systemic Integration Requirements

**Insufficient Isolation**: UBI alone, on blockchain or not, is not enough to solve the problems its proponents argue against.

**Production Integration**: UBI would be helpful as a tool if plugged into a model of production embedded into a political strategy aiming to fix key problems of current societies.

**Political Strategy Needs**: Requires broader political and economic transformation beyond just income distribution.

## Blockchain Technology Assessment

### Advantages of Blockchain Implementation

**Global Accessibility**: Now for the first time in history, it is trivially easy to create financial applications that are universally accessible to anyone on the Internet.

**Smart Contract Automation**: Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models.

**Decentralized Identity**: The system's native Sybil-attack resistance and inbuilt decentralized identity make it an ideal focus for grassroots action and community organization.

### Technical Limitations

**Scalability Concerns**: Need for methods to further decentralise governance while maintaining system functionality.

**User Experience**: Technical complexity may limit adoption among target populations who would most benefit from UBI.

**Infrastructure Dependencies**: Reliance on blockchain infrastructure that may not be accessible to all potential users.

## Future Research Directions

### Sustainability Studies

**Economic Viability**: Future research is needed to identify methods to ensure sustainability of self-organised CCSs adopting a UBI issuance scheme.

**Governance Decentralization**: Methods to further decentralise governance while maintaining system integrity.

**Integration Models**: Research on how UBI systems can integrate with broader economic transformation strategies.

### Comparative Analysis

**Cross-Project Learning**: Comparison with other blockchain-based social economy projects.

**Traditional CCS Comparison**: Analysis versus non-blockchain community currency systems.

**Policy Integration**: Research on integration with government social programs and policies.
