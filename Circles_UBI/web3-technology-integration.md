# Circles UBI - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Information

**Has Token**: Yes

**Token Structure**: 
- **Type**: Individualized Personal Cryptocurrencies
- **System**: Each user gets their own personal cryptocurrency when they join
- **Blockchain**: Gnosis Chain (deployed October 2020)
- **Distribution**: Regular minting to user accounts forming UBI basis
- **Convergence**: Personal currencies converge into single global monetary system through trust networks

**Unique Architecture**: Circles is an entirely new way of looking at the nature of money and what value exchange means in a post-UBI future. Circles is a money system that is made up of individual currencies.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

**Primary Blockchain**: Gnosis Chain
- **Deployment Date**: October 2020
- **Smart Contract Platform**: Built on smart contract-enabled blockchain
- **Design Philosophy**: Circles proposes to be the blockchain's native UBI money system

**Technical Innovation**: Smart contracts and the blockchain create a very promising environment in which to implement a new UBI system.

## Tokenomics and Economic Model

### Personal Currency System

**Individual Token Creation**: When new users join Circles, a new personal cryptocurrency is created for them on a smart contract-enabled blockchain.

**Automatic Minting**: This currency is then regularly minted and added to their account, forming the basis of Circles' UBI properties.

**Trust-Based Exchange**: Users have the ability to trust the personal currencies of other users, which requires them to treat this personal currency as identical to any other Circles currencies that they hold.

### Network Effects and Convergence

**Social Graph Integration**: We propose a new money system called Circles that is based on individualized cryptocurrencies and a social graph of trust between these currencies.

**Monetary Convergence**: As the social graph becomes more interconnected, these personal currencies converge on one single global monetary system.

**Wealth Equalization**: This money system will be for the purposes of distributing money in a way which will, over time, lead to the equalization of wealth and function like a globally accessible Universal Basic Income.

## Decentralized Governance and Identity

### Anti-Sybil Mechanisms

**Built-in Resistance**: It has its own built-in resistance to Sybil attacks (i.e. fake accounts) and anyone can join the network at any time without asking permission from anyone.

**Web of Trust**: Implementation of the Web of Trust protocol as an anti-sybil solution.

**Decentralized Identity**: The system's native Sybil-attack resistance and inbuilt decentralized identity make it an ideal focus for grassroots action and community organization.

### Governance Structure

**Permissionless Entry**: Anyone can join the network at any time without asking permission from anyone.

**Extensible Governance**: It has been designed with the expectation that it will be bootstrapped in a completely organic and grassroots fashion, but is extensible to allow any arbitrary governance systems to operate on top of the base protocol.

**Democratic Principles**: Circles aims at the decentralization of economic and political power via democratic and autonomous practices.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Automated UBI Distribution

**Smart Contract Minting**: Personal cryptocurrencies are automatically minted through smart contracts on regular basis.

**Trust Relationship Management**: Smart contracts manage trust relationships between different personal currencies.

**Exchange Mechanisms**: Automated systems for converting between trusted personal currencies within the network.

### Token Economy Policies

**Policy Enforcement**: Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models.

**Programmable Economics**: Implementation of economic rules through code rather than traditional institutional mechanisms.

**Transparent Operations**: All transactions and relationships recorded on blockchain for transparency and auditability.

## Community Currency Integration

### Local Economic Networks

**Community Focus**: Recent advancements of blockchain technologies ensure security and trustability of Community Currency Systems (CCSs), enabling their increasingly widespread adoption.

**Local Governance**: These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local.

**Economic Sovereignty**: Focus on creating locally controlled economic systems that serve community needs.

### Business Integration

**Merchant Adoption**: Berlin pilot included subsidy program involving local businesses.

**Economic Network Growth**: Findings suggest that the pilot project sustained the expansion of the economic network and the system facilitated trade in urban communities in Berlin.

**Local Exchange**: Support for local business participation in community currency ecosystem.

## Technical Limitations and Challenges

### Scalability Issues

**Network Growth**: Need for methods to ensure sustainability of self-organised CCSs adopting a UBI issuance scheme.

**Governance Decentralization**: Future research needed to identify methods to further decentralise their governance.

**Infrastructure Requirements**: Dependence on blockchain infrastructure that may limit accessibility.

### User Experience Barriers

**Technical Complexity**: Blockchain interactions may be challenging for target UBI populations.

**Digital Divide**: Technology requirements may exclude those who would most benefit from UBI systems.

**Education Needs**: Requirement for user education on blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts.

## Integration with Broader Web3 Ecosystem

### ReFi Connections

**Regenerative Economics**: Connection to broader regenerative finance movement through focus on commons regeneration.

**Social Economy**: Part of emerging Web3 social economy projects focused on community empowerment.

**Democratic Finance**: Alignment with decentralized finance principles while focusing on social rather than purely financial outcomes.

### Blockchain Innovation

**Novel Architecture**: First known implementation of individualized cryptocurrencies for UBI distribution.

**Social Graph Integration**: Innovative use of trust networks for monetary policy and exchange.

**Community Currency Evolution**: Next-generation community currency system leveraging blockchain capabilities.

## Implementation Status and Roadmap

### Current Status: Discontinued Operations

**Operational Cessation**: Due to financial limitations, our operations cease as of January 2024.

**Continued Infrastructure**: Our wallet, user support, and the marketplace remain operational.

**Future Development**: We are currently in the process of shaping the future of the Circles project.

### Technical Legacy

**Protocol Persistence**: Underlying blockchain protocol continues to exist independent of organizational operations.

**Community Continuation**: Technical infrastructure allows community to continue using system without central coordination.

**Open Source Foundation**: Extensible architecture enables community development and governance innovation.

## Research and Development

### Academic Collaboration

**Research Integration**: Extensive academic study provides foundation for future development.

**Open Source Development**: Community-driven development model aligned with Web3 principles.

**Experimental Economics**: Platform for experimenting with new economic models and monetary policies.

### Future Technical Development

**Protocol Evolution**: Potential for community-driven protocol improvements and governance innovations.

**Integration Opportunities**: Possibility for integration with other Web3 social economy projects.

**Scaling Solutions**: Ongoing research into sustainable scaling of community currency systems.

## Comparison with Traditional Cryptocurrencies

### Bitcoin vs. Circles Comparison

**Distribution Mechanism**: Unlike Bitcoin's mining-based distribution, Circles provides direct UBI-style distribution to all users.

**Accessibility**: Designed for universal access rather than technical/financial gatekeeping.

**Purpose**: Social and economic inclusion rather than store of value or speculative investment.

**Governance**: Community-driven rather than miner/developer controlled.

### Innovation in Monetary Design

**Individual Currencies**: Unique approach of personal currencies rather than single shared token.

**Trust-Based Value**: Value derived from social trust networks rather than scarcity or utility.

**Equalizing Mechanism**: Designed specifically for wealth equalization rather than wealth concentration.

**Democratic Money**: Money creation distributed among users rather than controlled by central entities.
