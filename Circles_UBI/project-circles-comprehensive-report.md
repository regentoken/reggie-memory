# Circles UBI - Comprehensive Report

## Project Overview
- **Website**: https://joincircles.net/
- **Secondary Site**: https://aboutcircles.com/
- **Handbook**: https://handbook.joincircles.net/
- **Research Date**: June 16, 2025
- **Category**: Universal Basic Income, Community Currency, Social Economy
- **Status**: Operations ceased January 2024 (Circles Coop shut down)

## Mission & Vision

**Mission**: Circles is an alternative currency, where communities can give each other a basic income - without waiting for the state.

**Vision**: Create a fairer and less concentrated cryptocurrency than Bitcoin and connect it with a political project aiming to provide a UBI for all people across the globe to cover their basic needs.

**Core Philosophy**: The decentralization of the production of money, claimed by people directly as a universal income through infrastructures like Circles, forms the basis of a democratic economy. Circles aims at the decentralization of economic and political power via democratic and autonomous practices.

## Legal/Organizational Structure

**Corporate Structure**: 
- **Circles Coop eG**: German cooperative that launched the project in 2021
- **Status**: Due to financial limitations, our operations cease as of January 2024
- **Current Status**: Wallet, user support, and marketplace remain operational

**Governance Model**: Designed with the expectation that it will be bootstrapped in a completely organic and grassroots fashion, but is extensible to allow any arbitrary governance systems to operate on top of the base protocol.

**Political Framework**: Based on Democratic Confederalism principles: every entity has the right to organise itself from the local to the universal.

## Founders, Leadership, and Team

**Academic Research Team**: Project has been extensively studied by researchers from:
- Panteion University (Athens, Greece)
- University of St. Gallen
- Multiple European research institutions

**Development Background**: Circles UBI is a protocol built and deployed on the Gnosis Chain in October 2020

**Community-Driven**: The project was designed to be bootstrapped organically by communities rather than led by traditional corporate structures.

## Key Projects and Pilot Studies

### Berlin Pilot Project (October 2021 - December 2023)

**Primary Implementation**: Circles UBI is a blockchain-based Community Currency System (CCS) that has been active in Berlin (Germany) since October 2021.

**Research Study**: Survey carried out between October and November 2023. The respondents were twenty-five individuals involved in various ways in the Circles' network.

**Community Impact**: After they participated in Circles, the community was mentioned twenty times as the most interesting aspect, succeeded by UBI with nineteen mentions and blockchain systems with only five.

### Geographic Presence

**Primary Location**: Berlin, Germany
**Scope**: Designed for global implementation but primarily tested in Berlin

**Community Focus**: We prefer to think of economies in the original sense of households, not defined by four walls but by the relations that reproduce them.

## Notable Media Mentions and Academic Coverage

**Academic Publications**:
- **Frontiers in Blockchain** (March 2024): "Universal basic income on blockchain: the case of circles UBI"
- **ArXiv** (2024): "Impact of a Blockchain-based Universal Basic Income Pilot: The case of Circles UBI currency"
- **ACM Conference** (2023): "Universal Basic Income in a Blockchain-Based Community Currency"

**Research Recognition**: To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of a universal basic income designed as a community currency and adopting blockchain technology.

## Timeline and Evolution

**October 2020**: Protocol deployed on Gnosis Chain
**October 2021**: Berlin pilot project launch
**October-November 2023**: Major research survey conducted
**December 2023**: Circles Coop shut down
**January 2024**: Operations ceased

**Current Phase**: We are currently in the process of shaping the future of the Circles project.

## Strategic Focus Areas

### Universal Basic Income Implementation
**Definition**: According to the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), basic income is a periodic money payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement.

**Characteristics**: UBI has 5 key characteristics implemented through blockchain technology

### Community Currency System
**Localized Economics**: Focus on community-based economic systems that empower local economies through decentralized currency governance

**Social Trust Networks**: Based on individualized cryptocurrencies and a social graph of trust between these currencies

### Democratic Economic Transformation
**Post-Capitalist Vision**: Anti-capitalistic values and the implementation of the Web of Trust protocol as an anti-sybil solution

**Political Project**: Connection to broader movements for economic democracy and social justice

## Community Perception and Impact

### User Motivations
**Primary Drivers**: Their participation was deeply motivated by their identification with the values and ideals of the Circles community.

**Value Resonance**: Circles's values of equality and post-capitalism resonated with their sparking interest.

### Project Perception
**User Categories**: The project was mainly perceived as a Universal Basic Income with eighteen mentions, followed by fifteen mentions for "means of payment", fourteen for "means of exchange", eleven for a "political tool"

**Community Profiles**: Research identified five distinct profiles of individuals and businesses that benefited from Circles UBI participation

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

### Implementation Challenges
**Financial Sustainability**: Due to financial limitations, our operations cease as of January 2024

**Adoption Barriers**: The project faced challenges in achieving sustainable economic network effects

### Research Insights
**Systemic Requirements**: UBI alone, on blockchain or not, is not enough to solve the problems its proponents argue against.

**Integration Needs**: UBI would be helpful as a tool if plugged into a model of production embedded into a political strategy aiming to fix key problems of current societies such as gaping inequalities and climate change.

## Theoretical Framework

### Open Cooperativism Model
**Alternative Economic System**: The model of open cooperativism induces a transvestment of capital into the regeneration of the commons, thereby resulting in the distribution and redistribution of profits, income, and rents.

**Transformation Strategy**: The model of open cooperativism forces capitalism to adapt to post-capitalism in the long run.

### Post-Capitalist Economics
**Democratic Money**: Focus on decentralizing monetary creation and distribution
**Community Sovereignty**: Emphasis on local economic self-determination
**Commons Regeneration**: Investment in shared resources and community wealth
