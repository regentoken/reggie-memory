# Circles UBI - Research Summary

## High-Level Summary of Findings

**Bottom Line**: Circles UBI represents a groundbreaking experiment in blockchain-based Universal Basic Income implementation that operated as a community currency system in Berlin from 2021-2023. While the organizational operations ceased due to financial limitations, the project provides critical insights into the challenges and potential of decentralized economic systems for social regeneration.

### Key Innovation: Individualized Cryptocurrency UBI

Circles' revolutionary approach creates a personal cryptocurrency for each user that is regularly minted as UBI, with value emerging through a "web of trust" social network. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely on scarcity or utility, Circles currencies derive value from social relationships and mutual trust, creating a completely new model for democratic money creation.

### Social and Political Achievement

The Berlin pilot demonstrated that 25 research participants were primarily motivated by community values and post-capitalist ideals rather than financial gain. The project successfully created strong community bonds and facilitated local economic exchange, with community connection being the most valued aspect of participation.

### Technical Implementation Success

Successfully deployed on Gnosis Chain with built-in Sybil attack resistance and permissionless entry. The system demonstrated that blockchain technology can enable grassroots economic organization without traditional institutional gatekeepers, creating new possibilities for democratic economic participation.

### Critical Lessons Learned

Research conclusively showed that "UBI alone, on blockchain or not, is not enough to solve the problems its proponents argue against." The project highlighted the need for UBI to be integrated with broader political and economic transformation strategies, particularly through models like "open cooperativism" that regenerate commons rather than extract from them.
