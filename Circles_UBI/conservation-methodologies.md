# Circles UBI - Conservation Methodologies

## Economic Regeneration Techniques

### Community Currency Implementation

**Localized Economic Development**: These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local.

**Economic Sovereignty**: Self-sustainability is achieved through localised interdependence between actors, who complement each other by providing the labor and resources that they need to live.

**Democratic Economic Participation**: The decentralization of the production of money, claimed by people directly as a universal income through infrastructures like Circles, forms the basis of a democratic economy.

### Wealth Distribution Strategies

**Equalization Mechanisms**: This money system will be for the purposes of distributing money in a way which will, over time, lead to the equalization of wealth and function like a globally accessible Universal Basic Income.

**Anti-Concentration Design**: Circles was to create a fairer and less concentrated cryptocurrency than Bitcoin and to connect it with a political project aiming to provide a UBI for all people across the globe.

**Redistribution Systems**: The model of open cooperativism induces a transvestment of capital into the regeneration of the commons, thereby resulting in the distribution and redistribution of profits, income, and rents.

## Social and Economic Restoration Strategies

### Commons Regeneration

**Resource Restoration**: The model of open cooperativism induces a transvestment of capital into the regeneration of the commons.

**Collective Wealth Building**: Focus on building shared community resources rather than individual wealth accumulation.

**Economic Democracy**: Democratic economic systems that give communities control over their economic destiny.

### Post-Capitalist Transition

**Systemic Transformation**: The model of open cooperativism forces capitalism to adapt to post-capitalism in the long run.

**Alternative Economic Models**: Experimentation with radically new economic models through smart contract implementation.

**Value System Shift**: Move from extractive economic relationships to regenerative economic relationships.

## Role of Local Communities

### Community-Driven Implementation

**Grassroots Organization**: It has been designed with the expectation that it will be bootstrapped in a completely organic and grassroots fashion.

**Local Ownership**: Community currency systems where governance and circulation are controlled locally rather than by external institutions.

**Household Economics**: We prefer to think of economies in the original sense of households, not defined by four walls but by the relations that reproduce them.

### Participation and Engagement

**Value Alignment**: Their participation was deeply motivated by their identification with the values and ideals of the Circles community.

**Community Priority**: After they participated in Circles, the community was mentioned twenty times as the most interesting aspect, succeeded by UBI with nineteen mentions.

**Social Connection**: Focus on building relationships and social networks that support economic cooperation.

### Training and Capacity Building

**Democratic Education**: Education about democratic economic principles and community currency operations.

**Technical Literacy**: Building capacity for blockchain and cryptocurrency participation among community members.

**Economic Empowerment**: Training communities to create and manage their own economic systems.

## Traditional Knowledge and Progressive Practices Integration

### Democratic Confederalism

**Indigenous Governance Models**: Democratic Confederalism starts from the notion that every entity has the right to organise itself from the local to the universal.

**Traditional Economic Principles**: Integration of traditional community-based economic practices with modern technology.

**Cultural Values**: Circles's values of equality and post-capitalism that resonate with traditional community values.

### Cooperative Economics

**Mutual Aid Traditions**: Building on historical traditions of mutual aid and community support.

**Gift Economy Elements**: Integration of gift economy principles alongside market exchange mechanisms.

**Collective Decision Making**: Traditional consensus-building practices applied to economic governance.

### Social Economy Practices

**Community Solidarity**: In the beginning, Circles may be implemented as an act of solidarity, care and support.

**Relationship-Based Economics**: Economic systems based on social relationships rather than pure market mechanisms.

**Cultural Integration**: Economic development that respects and builds on existing cultural practices.

## Data Collection and Monitoring Frameworks

### Blockchain-Based Monitoring

**Transparent Transactions**: All transactions recorded on blockchain for complete transparency and auditability.

**Network Analysis**: Analysis of structural changes in the network, especially in relation to subsidy programs involving local businesses.

**User Behavior Tracking**: Investigation of how the UBI was effectively spent and what economic patterns emerged.

### Academic Research Framework

**Qualitative Assessment**: Financial diaries methodology to understand the financial lives and decision-making processes of participants.

**Survey Research**: Survey carried out between October and November 2023 with twenty-five individuals involved in various ways in the Circles' network.

**Longitudinal Studies**: Tracking cash flows and decision-making processes of individuals and communities over time.

### Community Feedback Systems

**Participant Interviews**: Research identified five profiles of individuals and businesses that stood for their difference in type and degree of involvement.

**Impact Stories**: Documentation of stories of economic linkages that suggest positive externalities from adopting local community currency.

**Community Assessment**: Regular evaluation of how community currency affects local economic relationships.

## Impact Metrics Tracked

### Economic Impact Measures

**Local Economic Activity**: Network analysis showing expansion of economic networks and facilitation of trade in urban communities.

**Wealth Distribution**: Measurement of wealth equalization effects over time through transaction analysis.

**Economic Inclusion**: Assessment of how many previously excluded individuals gained access to economic participation.

### Social Impact Metrics

**Community Cohesion**: Measurement of social trust networks and relationship building within communities.

**Democratic Participation**: Assessment of community participation in economic governance and decision-making.

**Social Capital**: Evaluation of social network strengthening and community relationship building.

### Network Growth Metrics

**User Adoption**: Tracking of new user onboarding and network expansion.

**Transaction Volume**: Analysis of economic activity and currency circulation within the network.

**Geographic Spread**: Measurement of community currency adoption across different geographic areas.

### Sustainability Indicators

**Economic Viability**: Assessment of long-term economic sustainability of community currency systems.

**Social Resilience**: Measurement of community capacity to maintain economic cooperation during challenges.

**Environmental Benefits**: Evaluation of reduced environmental impact through localized economic activity.

**Adaptation Methodology**: Framework for adapting community currency systems to different cultural and economic contexts.

**Best Practices**: Documentation of lessons learned from Berlin pilot for future implementations.

## Regenerative Principles Implementation

### Economic Democracy

**Power Decentralization**: Circles aims at the decentralization of economic and political power via democratic and autonomous practices.

**Community Sovereignty**: Every entity has the right to organise itself from the local to the universal.

**Participatory Economics**: Systems that enable meaningful economic participation by all community members.

### Commons-Based Development

**Shared Resource Creation**: Focus on building commons rather than private wealth accumulation.

**Collective Ownership**: Models of shared ownership and stewardship of economic resources.

**Regenerative Investment**: Investment patterns that regenerate rather than extract from communities.

### Post-Capitalist Economics

**Alternative Value Systems**: Economic systems based on cooperation rather than competition.

**Non-Extractive Exchange**: Exchange mechanisms that build rather than deplete community resources.
