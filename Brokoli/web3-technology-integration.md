# Brokoli Network - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Ecosystem

### BRKL (Primary Governance Token)
**Token:** BRKL  
**Type:** ERC-20 Token on Ethereum Blockchain  
**Maximum Supply:** 125,000,000 BRKL  
**Circulating Supply:** 53.47 Million tokens (as of latest data)  
**Current Price:** ~$0.0037 USD  

**Core Functions:**
- **DAO Governance**: BRKL holders vote on climate project selection and fund allocation
- **Staking Rewards**: Stakers earn BRKL rewards and participate in governance decisions
- **Climate Fee Distribution**: 10% of collected climate fees distributed to community
- **Deflationary Mechanism**: Token burning through various platform activities

### SEED (Secondary Utility Token)
**Token:** SEED  
**Type:** ERC-20 Native Token  
**Utility:** Earned by using Brokoli Network's Green DeFi products  
**Function:** Real utility in the Green Metaverse ecosystem  

**Use Cases:**
- Staking alongside BRKL for enhanced rewards
- In-metaverse currency for Green Metaverse activities
- Plant-to-earn mechanics within the ecosystem
- Enhanced governance participation when combined with BRKL

## Blockchain Infrastructure

### Multi-Chain Deployment
**Primary Networks:**
- **Ethereum**: Main deployment for BRKL token and core contracts
- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: Expanded deployment for DeFi integrations
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Designed for additional blockchain integration

**Technical Architecture:**
- Layer 1 and Layer 2 compatibility for efficient transactions
- Bridge technology for cross-chain asset transfers
- API standardization across different blockchain networks

### Smart Contract System
**Core Contracts:**
- **BRKL Token Contract**: ERC-20 implementation with deflationary features
- **Climate Fee Collection**: Automated fee calculation and collection system
- **NFT Forest Contracts**: Digital tree and forest NFT minting and trading
- **DAO Governance**: Voting and proposal management system

## ReFi Mechanics and Economic Design

### Climate Fee Mechanism
**Automated Fee Collection:**
- Real-time calculation of transaction carbon footprint
- Optional user participation in climate fee contribution
- Native token collection from partner platforms
- Automatic conversion to BRKL for ecosystem value

**Fee Distribution Model:**
- **90%**: Direct funding of environmental projects (tree planting, renewable energy, e-waste)
- **10%**: Community rewards distributed as follows:
  - 1/3 to stakers and governance participants
  - 1/3 random distribution to platform users
  - 1/3 used for token burning (deflationary pressure)

### Deflationary Tokenomics
**Token Burning Mechanisms:**
- Green fees used for token burns
- PvP competition entry fees
- Travel costs between metaverse habitats
- Gambling and gaming activities

**Supply Management:**
- Limited maximum supply of 125M BRKL
- Progressive supply reduction through burning
- Equilibrium maintained through supply/demand dynamics
- Gaming and staking rewards balanced against burning activities

## GameFi and Metaverse Integration

### Green Metaverse Economy
**Virtual Ecosystem:**
- **Digital Habitats**: Virtual environments representing different ecosystems
- **PvP Competitions**: Player vs player tournaments with BRKL entry fees
- **Mini-games**: Various environmental-themed games with token rewards
- **Travel System**: Movement between habitats requiring BRKL expenditure

**Play-to-Earn Mechanics:**
- Tournament winnings in BRKL tokens
- Mini-game rewards for successful gameplay
- Achievement-based token distribution
- Social impact rewards for environmental contributions

### NFT Digital Forests
**Impact-to-Earn NFTs:**
- **Tree NFTs**: Representing individual trees funded through platform usage
- **Forest Collections**: Aggregated NFTs representing larger environmental impact
- **Dynamic Metadata**: NFTs evolve based on real-world project progress
- **Tradeable Assets**: Peer-to-peer trading of environmental impact

**Brokoli Impact Credits:**
- Corporate Social Responsibility standard
- Loosely pegged to real forest projects
- Purchased by corporate partners for CSR purposes
- Decentralized alternative to traditional carbon credits

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

### Governance Structure
**Decision-Making Authority:**
- 100% community control over climate offset funding
- Token-weighted voting on project selection
- Democratic allocation of funds between project categories
- Transparent proposal and voting processes

**Governance Categories:**
- **Tree Planting Projects**: Selection and funding of reforestation initiatives
- **Renewable Energy**: Investment in clean energy infrastructure
- **E-Waste Programs**: Electronic waste collection and recycling projects
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Approval of corporate and platform integrations

### Instant Governance Innovation
**Inclusive Participation:**
- Community members can participate without owning BRKL
- Specific protocol settings voted on by broader community
- Transparent and accessible governance for all users
- Democratic decision-making beyond token ownership
