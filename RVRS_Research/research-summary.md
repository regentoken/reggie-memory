# RVRS (Reverse Climate Change) - Research Summary

## Executive Overview

RVRS is "the climate change reversing crypto token" and positions itself as an impact token - a meme token with a higher purpose. The project's goal is to use blockchain to impact the fight against climate change by directing all trading revenue to environmental causes, primarily tree planting and CO2 removal.

## Key Research Findings

### Meme Token with Environmental Purpose

- **Revenue Commitment**: All revenue generated from trading goes to support environmental causes
- **Simple Solution**: Focus on tree planting as the simplest solution to reversing climate change

### Community-Driven Impact
- **Blockchain Platform**: Polygon network deployment (Contract: 0x5dd175a4242afe19e5c1051d8cd13fc8979f2329)
