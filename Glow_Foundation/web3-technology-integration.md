# Glow Foundation - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Information

**Has Token**: Yes

**Token Details**:
- **Token Name**: GLW
- **Token Type**: Utility Token
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Distribution**: 175,000 tokens distributed weekly to highest-performing farms
- **Utility**: Rewards for electricity production, governance participation, carbon credit purchases

**Secondary Token Integration**:
- **USDC**: Stablecoin rewards for carbon credit production
- **Dual Token Economy**: GLW for electricity output, USDC for carbon credits

## Blockchain Infrastructure

**Primary Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Consensus**: Proof of Stake (99.95% more energy-efficient than Proof of Work)
- **Protocol Type**: DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)
- **Architecture**: Foundational DePIN principles creating solar acceleration flywheel

**Smart Contract Integration**:
- Automated reward distribution based on verified performance
- Transparent tracking of energy production and carbon credit generation
- Governance mechanisms for protocol upgrades and farm verification

## Tokenomics and Economic Model

### Recursive Subsidy Mechanism

**Core Innovation**: Glow's recursive subsidy requires solar farms to contribute 100% of their electricity savings and revenue towards the construction of even more solar. This creates a powerful amplification effect.

**Incentive Structure**:
- **GLW Rewards**: Proportional to electricity revenue brought to protocol
- **USDC Rewards**: Proportional to total carbon impact
- **Dual Optimization**: Incentivizes both revenue maximization and environmental impact

### Token Distribution and Economics

**Weekly Distribution**: 175,000 GLW tokens distributed to highest-performing farms

**Reward Allocation**:
- Solar farms receive GLW tokens for electricity production
- Solar farms receive USDC for carbon credit production
- Financiers earn token rewards for funding farm construction

**Deflationary Mechanics**: GLW is used to purchase carbon credits and then those tokens are pulled out of circulation, creating price pressure and bringing value to the Glow ecosystem.

## Decentralized Governance

### Governance Structure

**Glow Certification Agents (GCAs)**:
- Elected through Glow's governance system
- Responsible for auditing solar farms to verify carbon credit production
- Report findings on-chain for transparency and integrity
- Ensure solar farms meet specific criteria

**Veto Council Members**:
- Elected individuals monitoring network activity
- Authority to halt suspicious or misguided actions
- Ensure governance actions align with system objectives
- Address anomalies in reports or proposals

### DAO Components

**Community Governance**: Stakeholders participate in protocol decisions through token-based voting mechanisms.

**Transparent Decision Making**: All governance actions recorded on-chain for public verification.

**Distributed Authority**: Multiple governance layers prevent centralized control while maintaining system integrity.

## MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)

### Digital MRV Infrastructure

**Third-Party Integration**: Glow uses third party data providers such as WattTime to measure the true carbon impact of the electricity produced by each solar panel.

**Physical Verification**: An auditor visits each solar farm to verify panel existence, Glow's quality standards compliance, and electricity production as claimed.

**Blockchain Recording**: Carbon credits get minted, where their status, ownership, and history can be transparently verified by anyone in the world.

### Data Transparency

**Public Verification**: All production data, carbon credits, and farm performance metrics available on public blockchain.

**Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of energy production and environmental impact.

**Immutable Records**: Blockchain ensures historical data cannot be altered or manipulated.

## ReFi Mechanics

### Staking and Rewards

**Electricity Staking**: Solar farms stake their electricity production to earn GLW tokens.

**Carbon Credit Rewards**: Farms earn USDC rewards proportional to verified carbon impact.

**Compound Growth**: 100% revenue recycling creates exponential expansion of network.

### Yield Generation

**Revenue Sources**:
- Electricity sales to grid
- Carbon credit monetization
- Token appreciation through deflationary mechanics
- Government incentives and tax credits

**Yield Distribution**: All revenue flows directed toward network expansion rather than profit extraction.

## Partnerships and Ecosystem

### ReFi Collective Integration

**Regenerative Finance Movement**: Glow is part of the broader Web3 regenerative finance ecosystem focused on environmental impact.

**DePIN Ecosystem**: Connected to other decentralized physical infrastructure projects demonstrating real-world utility of blockchain technology.

### Investment Partners

**Framework Ventures**: Lead investor with focus on crypto infrastructure and DePIN projects.

**Union Square Ventures**: Traditional VC with increasing focus on sustainable technology and Web3 applications.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Current Status: Live Protocol

**Active Operations**: 63 operational solar farms producing verified energy and carbon credits.

**Production Data**: 365 megawatt-hours of electricity produced to date.

**Geographic Expansion**: Active in US with India expansion underway.

### Near-Term Development (18 months)

**Scale Target**: Growth from 5 MW to 600 MW capacity.

**Geographic Expansion**: Entry into new international markets.

**Infrastructure Development**: Enhanced monitoring and verification systems.

### Long-Term Vision

**Global Network**: Worldwide solar infrastructure network powered by recursive subsidy model.

**Energy Transition**: Displacement of fossil fuel energy through abundant clean power generation.

**Financial Innovation**: New models for sustainable infrastructure funding and operation.

## Technology Stack

### Core Infrastructure

**Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum smart contracts for governance, rewards, and verification.

**Oracle Integration**: Third-party data providers for accurate environmental measurement.

**Physical Layer**: Distributed solar farm network with standardized monitoring equipment.

### Integration Capabilities

**Carbon Market Integration**: Direct connection to voluntary carbon markets through tokenized credits.

**DeFi Compatibility**: GLW and carbon credit tokens compatible with broader DeFi ecosystem.

**Enterprise Integration**: API access for corporations and institutions seeking renewable energy solutions.
