# Glow Foundation - Technical Background

## Scientific and Environmental Basis

### Solar Energy Economics

**Cost Transformation**: The cost of installing solar at scale has decreased by 5x since the year 2010. In fact, solar is now cheaper than all sources of dirty energy.

**Accessibility and Maintenance**: Once built, a solar installation will typically continue to operate for more than 25 years. Maintenance, if needed at all, has costs measured in the hundreds of dollars per decade. No other energy source is so accessible, affordable, and maintainable.

**Democratic Energy**: Solar is democratic energy. Especially with financing, nearly anyone can get involved and contribute to a cleaner society at a physical level.

### Energy Infrastructure Challenges

**Current Energy Inefficiencies**: Traditional energy systems rely on centralized, fossil fuel-powered infrastructure that externalizes environmental costs and lacks transparent accountability mechanisms.

**Market Failures**: Traditional subsidy systems allocate money based on output rather than profitability, resulting in money being wasted on profitable solar farms without creating more energy.

## Urgency and Scale of the Problem

### Climate Crisis Context

**Carbon Emissions**: The failure of our nation states to mobilize capital to finance the world's climate crisis solutions are putting humanity's future on a bleak horizon.

**Global Warming Trajectory**: We're looking at 3–3.5°C warming this century based on current policies in place, far exceeding the Paris Agreement goals.

**Time Constraint**: We have just under 8 years left to reduce global emissions by 50% and close the emissions gap to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.

**Scale Requirements**: We're talking about reducing global emissions by over 30 gigatonnes per year, when we're currently increasing global emissions at a near record rate.

### Financial Gap Analysis

**Coordination Failure**: Climate change is a global coordination problem, not a technology problem. Human organizational systems have failed to coordinate the commitments and capital necessary to address the most existential threat of our time.

**Infrastructure Investment Needs**: Bridge the financing gap for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage (currently estimated in the trillions of dollars).

## Climate-Related Risks and Financial Impact

### Environmental Risks Addressed

**Carbon Displacement**: By competing directly with fossil fuel energy sources, Glow farms help displace carbon-intensive energy production.

**Energy Grid Transformation**: Glow's model creates borderline absurd amounts of clean energy through incentive alignment that traditional markets fail to achieve.

**Systemic Change**: Whether or not they realize it, every coal and natural gas power plant around the world now has an expiration date.

### Economic Risk Mitigation

**Energy Price Volatility**: Solar farms provide stable, predictable energy costs compared to volatile fossil fuel markets.

**Regulatory Risk**: As carbon pricing and environmental regulations increase globally, solar infrastructure becomes increasingly valuable.

**Stranded Assets**: Traditional energy infrastructure faces increasing risk of becoming stranded assets as clean energy becomes dominant.

## Technical Papers, Data, and Evidence

### Measurement and Verification

**Third-Party Verification**: Glow uses third party data providers such as WattTime to measure the true carbon impact of the electricity produced by each solar panel.

**On-Chain Auditing**: An auditor visits each solar farm to verify panel existence, Glow's quality standards compliance, and electricity production as claimed.

**Transparent Accounting**: Carbon credits get minted, where their status, ownership, and history can be transparently verified by anyone in the world.

### Performance Metrics

**Current Production**: 365 megawatt-hours of electricity produced to date across 63 operational solar farms.

**Efficiency Gains**: Bitcoin miners were able to improve the efficiency of Bitcoin ASICs by more than 60,000x, demonstrating the potential for rapid efficiency improvements in DePIN systems.

**Scale Comparisons**: Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than the 36th largest country in the world, Filecoin's storage network has tens of millions of terabytes of data, and Helium spawned more than 1 million network hotspots in 60,000 cities around the world.

## Maps, Satellite Insights, and Modeling

### Geographic Distribution

**Current Presence**: Primary operations in the United States with expansion planned to India.

**Site Selection**: Glow seeks out solar farms that are borderline viable and gives them just barely enough money to get them over the line for construction.

**Monitoring Infrastructure**: Uses blockchain-based verification combined with physical auditing to ensure accurate reporting of solar production and environmental impact.

### Technological Infrastructure

**Blockchain Integration**: Ethereum-based protocol that enables transparent, verifiable tracking of energy production and carbon credit generation.

**DePIN Architecture**: Foundational DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) principles create a solar acceleration flywheel similar in nature to Bitcoin mining.

**Smart Contract Automation**: Automated distribution of rewards based on verified performance metrics eliminates middleman inefficiencies.

## Environmental Impact Modeling

### Scalability Projections

**18-Month Target**: Scale from 5 MW to 600 MW capacity represents a 120x growth factor.

**Long-term Vision**: If every person globally committed just $5 per month, we could revolutionize the world's energy landscape, migrating the entire planet to solar power in under two years.

### Carbon Impact Assessment

**Direct Impact**: Each solar farm directly displaces fossil fuel energy production in its local grid.

**Recursive Amplification**: 100% of electricity revenue gets redirected to building additional solar infrastructure, creating compound environmental benefits.

**Verification Standards**: All carbon credits are generated through verified, third-party audited solar production with blockchain-based transparency.
