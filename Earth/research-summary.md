# Earthbanc - Research Summary

## High-Level Summary of Findings

Earthbanc represents a pioneering integration of advanced technology and regenerative agriculture to create scalable solutions for climate change mitigation and community development. Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Stockholm, the company has developed proprietary AI and satellite-based monitoring systems to enable large-scale agroforestry and ecosystem restoration projects across multiple continents.

### Revolutionary Technology Approach
Earthbanc's core innovation lies in combining artificial intelligence, satellite remote sensing, and blockchain technology to create the world's first vertically integrated, full-stack nature-based carbon removal company. Their patented MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) technology has audited over 13 million hectares of forest globally, demonstrating unprecedented scale and accuracy in carbon measurement.

### Community-Centered Impact Model
The company's approach prioritizes farmers and landowners as true partners, supporting sustainable livelihoods and income generation while achieving environmental objectives. With over 4,000 active users managing 90,000+ hectares through their mobile application, Earthbanc demonstrates how technology can enable inclusive participation in carbon markets.

### Massive Scale Potential
Through partnerships with organizations like the UNCCD and African Development Bank, Earthbanc has developed a pipeline covering up to 100 million hectares for carbon removal projects. The Great Green Wall initiative alone represents 156 million hectares with potential to generate $7.25 billion in carbon credit revenue for local farmers.

### Web3 Integration Leadership
As an early adopter of regenerative finance (ReFi), Earthbanc has successfully integrated blockchain technology through their protocol on Regen Network, offering 8-15% APY yields for staked carbon credits and pioneering accessible carbon banking for the unbanked population globally.
