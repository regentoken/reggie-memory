# Carbon Counting Club - Research Summary

## Executive Overview

Carbon Counting Club is an innovative online gardening club that combines NFT fundraising for tree planting with cryptocurrency rewards for at-home carbon sequestration through natural gardening methods. The project was recognized as a finalist in Prince of Wales' Terra Carta Design Lab for improving transparency in the soil carbon offset market.

## Key Research Findings

### Grassroots Carbon Sequestration
- **Community Focus**: Online gardening club rewarding home-based carbon sequestration
- **Verification Model**: 1 Carbon Counting Coin minted per pound of CO2 verified as sequestered in gardens
- **Social Media Integration**: Users post gardening activities on X (Twitter) with Polygon address and #CarbonCounting hashtag to claim tokens

### Financial Innovation
- **Liquid Backing**: Over 50% liquid backed by diverse portfolio of carbon credits and crypto assets
- **Price Stability**: Diversity helps maintain price stability through automated market maker rebalancing
- **NFT Integration**: Offset NFTs purchase but don't retire carbon credits, placing them into liquidity pools

### Recognition & Validation
- **Royal Recognition**: Finalist in Prince of Wales' Terra Carta Design Lab climate innovation competition
- **Focus Area**: Improving transparency of soil carbon offset market through blockchain technology
- **Design Innovation**: Recognized alongside 19 other climate innovation finalists

## Technology Framework

### Blockchain Integration
- **Polygon Network**: Operating on Polygon blockchain for cost-effective transactions
- **Token Economics**: Carbon Counting Coin with mint rate limited by verification rate of real-world carbon sequestration
- **NFT Mechanism**: Offset NFTs contributing to protocol liquidity rather than retiring credits

### Verification System
- **Real-World Impact**: Direct verification of carbon sequestration in home gardens
- **Community Participation**: Social media-based claiming system encouraging participation
- **Measurement Framework**: Standardized carbon content measurement per gardening container (5-gallon/20-liter buckets)
