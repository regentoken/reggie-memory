# WeatherXM - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

WeatherXM operates as a community-powered decentralized weather network that aims to revolutionize weather forecasting through blockchain technology and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). Their core mission focuses on building the world's largest community-driven weather network that rewards station owners with $WXM tokens while providing accurate, hyperlocal weather services to individuals, businesses, and research organizations.

The project's vision centers on creating "Weather 3.0" - an entirely new weather data economy that democratizes access to high-quality weather information, particularly in underserved and rural areas worldwide. WeatherXM seeks to improve global weather forecasting accuracy while creating economic incentives for community participation in data collection.

## Legal & Organizational Structure

**Corporate Structure**: WeatherXM operates through the WeatherXM Network Association, a non-profit organization that promotes the use of services within the traditional GNSS and IoT industry. The association manages the $WXM token governance and coordinates network development.

**Governance Model**: The WeatherXM Foundation aligns the interests of miners and users, with the community actively participating in shaping future development through discussions, proposals, and voting using $WXM tokens. The project employs a WXM Improvement Proposal (WIP) system for democratic governance.

**Legal Framework**: The foundation seeks to create sustainable incentive structures that balance community participation with commercial viability, operating under Swiss regulatory framework.
