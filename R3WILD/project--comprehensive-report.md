# R3WILD - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

R3WILD operates as a blockchain-powered biodiversity bond marketplace that enables investment in African wilderness conservation through tokenized land assets. Their core mission focuses on protecting over 6 million hectares of wilderness in Africa by 2030, creating conservation corridors that allow animals and biodiversity to move freely and expand naturally.

The project's vision centers on redefining conservation fintech by offering a direct, transparent, and impactful way for both institutional and individual investors to contribute to and profit from the preservation of wilderness areas and biodiversity. R3WILD aims to create sustainable economic incentives for conservation while uplifting local communities through ecotourism and educational opportunities.

## Legal & Organizational Structure

**Corporate Structure**: R3WILD operates as a conservation technology platform that combines traditional land acquisition with blockchain-based biodiversity bonds, creating a marketplace for wilderness investment.

**Business Model**: The platform operates on a biodiversity bond model where:
- Each bond represents ownership of a physical hectare of wilderness land
- Investors receive annual carbon coupons and attractive yields
- Funds go directly to land conservation, restoration, and community development
- Easy transfer and sale of land bonds without traditional legal paperwork

**Investment Structure**: Both institutional and individual investors can participate in biodiversity impact bonds that provide:
- Long-term impact investment opportunities
- Measurable environmental and social returns
- Transparent tracking of conservation outcomes
- Liquidity through blockchain-based transferability
