# Carbon Credit Tokenization - Technical Background

## Scientific & Environmental Basis

### Carbon Sequestration Science
Carbon credits are based on scientifically measurable removal or avoidance of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Each credit represents one metric tonne of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) that has been:
- **Removed**: Through natural processes like photosynthesis in forests or technological means like direct air capture
- **Avoided**: Through projects that prevent emissions compared to baseline scenarios (renewable energy, methane capture)
- **Reduced**: Through efficiency improvements that lower emissions intensity

### Measurement & Verification Standards
Carbon credits rely on rigorous scientific methodologies for quantification:
- **Additionality**: Projects must demonstrate emissions reductions wouldn't have occurred without carbon finance
- **Permanence**: Long-term storage assurance, particularly for forest and soil carbon projects
- **Leakage Prevention**: Accounting for indirect emissions increases in other locations
- **Baseline Establishment**: Scientific determination of counterfactual emission scenarios

### Ecosystem Services Integration
Modern carbon projects increasingly recognize the interconnection between carbon and other environmental benefits:
- **Biodiversity Enhancement**: Forest conservation projects protect habitat and species diversity
- **Watershed Protection**: Many projects improve water quality and availability
- **Soil Health**: Agricultural carbon projects enhance soil fertility and resilience
- **Community Benefits**: Local economic development and traditional knowledge preservation

## Urgency & Scale of the Problem

### Climate Crisis Timeline
Current atmospheric CO2 levels exceed 420 ppm, the highest in over 3 million years. To limit warming to 1.5Â°C as outlined in the Paris Agreement, global emissions must:
- **Reduce by 45%** by 2030 compared to 2010 levels
- **Reach net zero** by 2050
- **Remove 10-20 gigatonnes** of CO2 annually through negative emissions technologies

### Voluntary Carbon Market Growth
The voluntary carbon market has experienced explosive growth:
- **$1 billion** market size in 2021, projected to reach **$100+ billion** by 2030
- **Demand increase** of 15-fold by 2030 and 100-fold by 2050 expected
- **Supply constraints** due to limited high-quality project development and verification bottlenecks

### Market Failures in Traditional Systems
Legacy carbon markets suffer from structural inefficiencies that limit climate impact:
- **Low prices** that don't incentivize sufficient project development
- **Quality concerns** from poor project oversight and verification
- **Limited accessibility** for small-scale projects and buyers
- **Lack of transparency** in pricing, ownership, and retirement

## Climate-Related Risks & Financial Impact

### Physical Risks to Carbon Projects
Climate change poses direct threats to carbon sequestration projects:
- **Forest Fires**: Increased wildfire risk threatens forest carbon projects globally
- **Extreme Weather**: Droughts, floods, and storms can damage projects and reverse carbon gains
- **Ecosystem Shifts**: Changing precipitation and temperature patterns affect project viability
- **Pest Outbreaks**: Climate-driven pest populations threaten forest health and carbon storage

### Transition Risks & Opportunities
- **Policy Changes**: Evolving carbon pricing mechanisms and regulations affect project values
- **Technology Disruption**: Advances in monitoring and verification change project economics
- **Market Evolution**: Shift toward higher-quality credits increases competition and standards
- **Corporate Commitments**: Growing net-zero pledges drive demand for high-integrity credits

### Financial Impact Quantification
- **Risk Premiums**: Physical and transition risks are increasingly priced into carbon credit valuations
- **Insurance Development**: Emerging parametric insurance products protect against carbon loss
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Geographic and methodological diversification reduces concentration risk
- **Regenerative Returns**: Projects with multiple environmental benefits command premium pricing
