# Centigrade - Research Summary

## Project Overview

Centigrade is a public-purpose company that operates as a central data utility for voluntary carbon markets, providing transparent, standardized, and accessible data infrastructure to restore trust and enable efficient market functioning. Founded in 2023 through a partnership between Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and Ripple, the platform addresses critical challenges in carbon market data opacity and fragmentation.

## Key Findings Summary

### Organizational Structure
- **Independent Data Utility**: Neutral position without conflicts of interest (doesn't own or trade credits)
- **Public Purpose Mission**: Focus on climate goals and equitable society development
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaboration with RMI (policy expertise) and Ripple (technology infrastructure)
- **Leadership**: Andreas Merkl as Co-founder and CEO

### Technology Infrastructure
- **No Native Token**: Operates as traditional platform rather than Web3 protocol
- **Blockchain Partnership**: Ripple connection suggests potential future blockchain integration
- **Open Data Platform**: Permissionless access with standardized data structures
- **API-First Design**: Enabling interoperability with 150+ carbon credit methodologies

### Market Impact Potential
- **$50B Market Opportunity**: Target market size by 2030 with proper infrastructure
- **Supply Development**: Platform for early-stage projects to access markets and financing
- **Transparency Enhancement**: Radical transparency addressing market trust issues
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reducing information asymmetry and transaction costs
