# Centigrade - Technical Background

## Scientific & Environmental Basis

### Voluntary Carbon Market Challenges
Centigrade addresses fundamental technical challenges in the voluntary carbon market (VCM) that have undermined its effectiveness and scalability. The platform tackles issues of data opacity, market fragmentation, and inconsistent standards that prevent efficient market functioning.

### Data Infrastructure Requirements
Modern carbon markets require fully digital, "live" data environments for profiling and tracking assets, including their performance over time. The data must be granular enough to allow project developers to profile their projects in their fully-differentiated detail while following common data standards.

## Problem Urgency & Scale

### Market Size & Growth Potential
- Current voluntary carbon market faces crisis of confidence despite tremendous growth potential
- Market could reach $50 billion by 2030 with proper infrastructure
- Critical financing mechanism needed for wide range of climate solutions, from halting deforestation to scaling direct air capture technologies

### Climate Timeline Pressures
- Less than 30 years remaining to achieve net zero by 2050
- Achieving net zero requires massive private-sector investments in carbon mitigation outside corporate value chains
- No shortage of investable mitigation solutions, but current market structure prevents efficient capital allocation

## Climate-Related Risks & Financial Impact

### Market Dysfunction Costs
- Information asymmetry creates high-risk, inefficient market conditions
- Buyers struggle to evaluate credit quality due to incomplete and inaccessible project data
- Developers face conflicting and duplicative reporting demands
- Verifiers work with static, inconsistent datasets, making reliable assessments difficult

### Financial Infrastructure Gaps
Current carbon credit market lacks characteristics of true functional markets:
- Reliable, standardized data for asset discovery and pricing
- Trustworthy and well-regulated intermediaries including auditors, rating agencies, and insurers
- Efficient, transparent, and well-regulated exchanges for transaction execution

## Technical Papers & Evidence

### RMI Research Foundation
Rocky Mountain Institute's Carbon Markets Initiative provides the scientific and policy foundation for Centigrade's approach, focusing on:
- Open, standardized data frameworks
- Carbon credit data quality analysis
- Buyer guidance for data-informed purchasing decisions
- Climate impact assessment of different carbon credit project types

### Standardized Data Structure
Developed in partnership with RMI, Centigrade's standardized data structure can accommodate any carbon credit methodology or pathway, spanning over 150 unique methodologies for generating carbon credits.

## Technical Methodologies

### Carbon Credit Classification
The platform addresses two primary credit categories:

**Ex Ante Credits**: Early lifecycle credits such as:
- Recently seeded forests
- Carbon removal plants under construction
- Projects with forward claims based on restoration, reduction, and removal potential

**Ex Post Credits**: Completed carbon activities representing:
- Carbon reduction or removal that has already occurred
- Verified and measured environmental impact
- Historical performance data

### Project Diversity
Carbon removal projects span multiple scientific domains:
- Engineered carbon dioxide reduction (biochar, enhanced rock weathering, BECCS)
- Nature restoration and conservation projects
- Agroforestry and regenerative agriculture
- Direct air capture technologies
- Forest protection and reforestation initiatives

## Monitoring & Verification Science

### Dynamic Data Requirements
The science behind baselining, monitoring, and analyzing carbon projects is constantly evolving, requiring adaptive data infrastructure that can accommodate:
- Changing scientific methodologies and pathways
- Real-time project performance monitoring
- Integration with remote sensing and machine learning technologies
- IoT devices feeding data on environmental conditions

### Quality Assurance Framework
Platform establishes minimum data disclosure requirements for:
- Project baseline establishment
- Monitoring methodology documentation
- Performance verification protocols
- Long-term impact tracking and reporting
