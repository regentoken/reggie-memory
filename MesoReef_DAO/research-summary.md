# MesoReef DAO - Research Summary

## Project Overview

MesoReef DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization focused on coral reef conservation using Decentralized Science (DeSci) and Web3 technologies to restore, protect, and preserve the Mesoamerican Reef System - the world's second-largest coral reef system spanning 1,000+ kilometers across Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The project combines advanced scientific expertise with blockchain-based governance to create sustainable, community-driven conservation solutions.
