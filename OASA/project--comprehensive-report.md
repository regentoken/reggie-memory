# OASA - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

OASA operates as a Web3-powered nature conservancy network that serves regenerative human living spaces and the planet. Their core mission focuses on creating a network of co-owned regenerative villages designed to accommodate modern citizens while preserving and regenerating the environment. The project aims to transition from traditional land ownership models to stewardship-based community governance.

OASA's vision centers on creating a future where traveling and living become one, where people can have roots in multiple geographies, and where love and community stay with individuals no matter where they go. The organization seeks to secure the interests of all living species while demonstrating that changing how we live is the most impactful way to regenerate ourselves and our planet.

## Legal & Organizational Structure

**Corporate Structure**: OASA is administratively registered as an association under Swiss law, operating as a network of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The organization functions as a web3-powered nature conservancy that issues tokens legally through Swiss jurisdiction.

**DAO Governance Model**: Each of the projected 12 OASA communities operates with a DAO acting as a legal entity that:
- Enforces principles of regeneration and land stewardship
- Manages community governance and decision-making
- Issues tokens for community participation and access
- Operates through proof-of-presence smart contracts for member booking and voting

**Network Structure**: OASA currently has:
- 20 active contributors across the network
- 50 members in its first operational DAO
- Multiple regenerative villages planned across 12 global locations
- Each village designed as a self-sustaining circular economy
