# OASA - Research Summary & Knowledge Base Overview

## Executive Summary

OASA represents a pioneering fusion of Web3 technology with regenerative community living, creating the world's first network of DAO-governed nature conservancy villages. Founded by Samuel Delesque, the project demonstrates how blockchain governance can enable community stewardship models that transition from extractive land ownership to regenerative stewardship, while creating sustainable economic opportunities aligned with ecological restoration.

**Key Innovation**: OASA pioneers the integration of DAO governance with physical regenerative communities, using blockchain technology to create democratic, transparent management of conservation-focused human settlements that actively restore ecosystems while providing modern living experiences.

**Bottom Line Impact**: With Traditional Dream Factory operational as a prototype in Portugal and plans for 12 global communities conserving 95% of their land as nature, OASA provides a scalable model for human settlements that contribute positively to planetary regeneration while demonstrating economic viability through Sacred Economy principles.
