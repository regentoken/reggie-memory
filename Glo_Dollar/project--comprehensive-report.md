# Glo Dollar - Comprehensive Report

## Mission & Vision

Glo Dollar represents a revolutionary approach to stablecoin design with a clear philanthropic mission: **leveraging cryptocurrency yields to end extreme poverty**. The project's core vision is to embed philanthropy into the very fabric of money, creating the world's first "anti-poverty stablecoin" that donates 100% of its profits to charitable causes.

**Mission Statement**: Fund public goods by holding a stablecoin. Unlike other stablecoin companies, Glo donates all profits to charity, unlocking up to $7.4 billion in funding for public goods and charitable causes.
