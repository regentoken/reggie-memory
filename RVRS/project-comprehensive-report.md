# RVRS (Reverse Climate Change) - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

RVRS (Reverse Climate Change) is an impact token designed as a "meme token with a higher purpose." The project's mission is to use blockchain technology to create a positive impact in the fight against climate change through trading transactions that automatically plant trees and remove CO2. Their vision is built on the simple principle that growing more trees is the simplest solution to reversing climate change.

The project transforms traditional meme token dynamics by directing all revenue generated from trading toward environmental causes, asking: "What if all revenue generated by trading meme tokens went to the environment? What impact would it have?" RVRS concludes the impact would be massive, introducing a new paradigm where "Degen, welcome Regen!"
