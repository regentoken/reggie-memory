# Basin - Technical Background

## Scientific & Environmental Basis

### Natural Capital Science
Natural capital represents the world's stock of natural resources including geology, soils, air, water, and living organisms that provide ecosystem services essential for human survival and economic activity. Basin's technical foundation rests on ecosystem services science that quantifies the economic value of natural systems and their contributions to human wellbeing.

### Ecosystem Services Framework
**Provisioning Services**: Food, water, timber, fiber, and other goods extracted from ecosystems
**Regulating Services**: Climate regulation, water purification, flood control, disease control, and pollination
**Cultural Services**: Recreation, spiritual values, educational value, and aesthetic beauty
**Supporting Services**: Soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling that underpin all other services

### Water Resource Management Science
Basin places particular emphasis on water-related natural capital including watersheds, aquifers, wetlands, and hydrological systems. The platform leverages hydrology, water quality science, and watershed management principles to create investable water infrastructure assets.

## Urgency & Scale of the Problem

### Natural Capital Degradation Crisis
Global natural capital is declining at unprecedented rates, with ecosystem services valued at $125 trillion annually facing systematic degradation. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study indicates that natural capital loss costs the global economy $2-5 trillion annually.

**Water Crisis Scale**: 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water, while 3.6 billion lack adequate sanitation. Climate change is intensifying water scarcity and flood risks globally.

**Biodiversity Loss**: Current species extinction rates are 100-1,000 times higher than natural background rates, threatening ecosystem stability and service provision.

**Financial Market Failures**: Traditional financial markets systematically undervalue natural capital, leading to chronic underinvestment in environmental infrastructure and ecosystem protection.

### Investment Gap Analysis
The UN estimates $44 trillion in natural capital investment is needed by 2030 to achieve sustainable development goals. Current investment levels represent less than 10% of required funding, highlighting massive market opportunity for innovative financing mechanisms.

## Climate-Related Risks & Financial Impact

### Physical Climate Risks to Natural Assets
**Extreme Weather**: Increased frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires threaten natural capital assets and ecosystem service provision.

**Sea Level Rise**: Coastal ecosystem degradation and saltwater intrusion affect coastal natural capital including mangroves, wetlands, and freshwater systems.

**Temperature Changes**: Shifting climate zones alter ecosystem composition, species distribution, and natural capital productivity.

### Transition Risks and Opportunities
**Policy Evolution**: Changing environmental regulations and carbon pricing create both risks and opportunities for natural capital investments.

**Technology Disruption**: Advances in monitoring, restoration, and management technologies affect natural capital asset values and investment returns.

**Market Evolution**: Growing demand for environmental assets creates opportunities while regulatory uncertainty creates risks.

### Financial Risk Mitigation
**Diversification Benefits**: Natural capital asset portfolios can provide diversification benefits and hedge against traditional financial market volatility.

**Inflation Protection**: Natural capital assets often provide inflation protection through their essential service provision and scarcity value.

**Long-term Value**: Environmental assets often appreciate over time as scarcity increases and ecosystem services become more valuable.
