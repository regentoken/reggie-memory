# NSET - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

NSET (formerly known as "The Sustainable Commodities Corporation") operates as a climate-smart commodities platform that transforms agricultural supply chains by turning commodities into decarbonization solutions. Their core mission focuses on enabling enterprises to claim actual Scope 3 emissions reductions while building resilient supply chains through climate-smart agricultural practices.

The company's vision centers on decarbonizing global supply chains and future-proofing the world's food supply by providing end-to-end solutions that cover farmers from seed-to-harvest, creating measurable emission reductions that reduce Scope 3 emissions and reliance on carbon offsets.

## Legal & Organizational Structure
