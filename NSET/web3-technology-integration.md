# NSET - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Status & Information

**Token**: None found

**Blockchain Integration**: While NSET does not appear to have its own native token, the platform incorporates blockchain technology through its digital passport system for commodity verification and traceability.

**Digital Asset Approach**: Rather than tokenization, NSET focuses on digital commodity passports that embed verified emissions data and compliance information directly with physical commodities.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

**Digital Passport Technology**: NSET employs blockchain-based digital passports that:
- Store complex incoming data in transparent, incorruptible, and up-to-date records
- Provide access for all interested supply chain parties
- Enable seed-to-harvest traceability with immutable data verification
- Support compliance reporting with audit-grade transparency

**Blockchain Implementation**: The platform leverages blockchain technology for:
- **Data Immutability**: Ensuring emissions and practice data cannot be tampered with
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Creating verifiable audit trails from farm to end consumer
- **Compliance Verification**: Automated reporting aligned with GHG Protocol and SBTi standards
- **Stakeholder Access**: Multi-party access to verified sustainability data

**Technology Infrastructure**:
- Integration with tools like Seedtrace for data capture and synchronization
- Offline capability ensuring data collection even without internet connectivity
- Real-time data uploading when connectivity is restored
- Cross-platform compatibility for various supply chain stakeholders

## Smart Contracts & Automation

**Automated Verification Systems**: While specific smart contract details are not publicly disclosed, NSET's system appears to include:
- Automated compliance reporting generation
- Real-time verification of regenerative practice implementation
- Dynamic premium calculation based on verified emissions reductions
- Automatic data embedding into digital commodity passports

**Settlement Mechanisms**: The platform enables:
- Automatic premium payments to farmers based on verified climate-smart production
- Revenue sharing with NSET based on premium value generated
- Compliance reporting automation for enterprise clients
- Third-party verification integration

## MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) Systems

**Digital MRV Infrastructure**: NSET's comprehensive MRV system includes:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WMO-certified Eddy Covariance Flux Towers providing 80-90% accuracy
- **Continuous Reporting**: Seed-to-harvest data collection and analysis
- **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable storage of all emissions and practice data
- **Automated Compliance**: Generation of audit-grade reports for regulatory requirements

**Data Integration**:
- IoT sensor networks for comprehensive environmental monitoring
- Satellite data integration for large-scale verification
- Ground-truth validation through field measurements
- Cross-verification with multiple data sources

## Decentralized Data Management

**Distributed Data Architecture**: The platform employs decentralized approaches to:
- Store commodity production data across distributed networks
- Enable multi-stakeholder access without central control points
- Ensure data redundancy and system resilience
- Provide transparent access to verification information

**Interoperability**: NSET's system is designed to:
- Integrate with existing commodity trading platforms
- Connect with enterprise sustainability reporting systems
- Interface with regulatory compliance frameworks
- Support third-party verification protocols
