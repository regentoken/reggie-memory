# NSET - Technical Background & Scientific Foundation

## Scientific & Environmental Basis

**Climate Change Impact on Agriculture**: Global agricultural systems face unprecedented challenges from climate change, with unpredictable weather patterns, severe El Ni√±o conditions, and crop diseases exacerbated by rising global temperatures reducing yields in major producing regions. These challenges are particularly acute in tropical commodity production zones.

**Scope 3 Emissions Challenge**: Corporate supply chains face significant challenges in measuring and reducing Scope 3 emissions, which often represent the largest portion of a company's carbon footprint. Traditional carbon offset approaches create accounting challenges as they exist outside value chains and pose greenwashing risks.

**Regenerative Agriculture Science**: Scientific research demonstrates that regenerative agricultural practices deliver multiple benefits:
- Soil health improvement through increased organic matter and enhanced nutrient cycling
- Biodiversity enhancement supporting ecosystem resilience
- Water quality improvement through reduced chemical inputs
- Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils
- Enhanced farm resilience to climate extremes

## Urgency & Scale of the Problem

**Supply Chain Disruption Statistics**:
- Climate change already impacting global supply chains with production disruptions and increased costs
- Rising commodity prices due to weather-related yield reductions
- Cocoa market example: 2023 global market valued at $16 billion, expected to grow to $22 billion by 2028
- West Africa dominates cocoa production (75% global supply) but faces severe climate vulnerability

**Economic Impact of Climate Risk**:
- **Production Cost Increases**: Implementation of sustainable practices increases production costs
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Port congestion, shipping delays, and transportation cost increases
- **Investor Speculation**: Market volatility driven by climate-related production uncertainties
- **Regulatory Pressure**: EU sustainability mandates creating compliance requirements

**Agricultural Productivity Challenges**:
- Small family-run farms (40-50 million farmers globally) lack resources for climate adaptation
- Traditional farming methods unable to cope with changing weather patterns
- Lack of access to premium markets for sustainably produced commodities
- Limited technical assistance for regenerative practice implementation

## Climate-Related Risks & Financial Impact

**Physical Climate Risks**:
- **Temperature Increases**: Crop heat stress and changing growing season patterns
- **Precipitation Changes**: Drought conditions and irregular rainfall affecting yields
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Hurricanes, floods, and storms disrupting production cycles
- **Pest and Disease Pressure**: Climate change enabling spread of agricultural pests and diseases

**Transition Risks**:
- **Regulatory Requirements**: EU sustainability mandates requiring supply chain transparency
- **Market Shifts**: Consumer and corporate demand for verified sustainable commodities
- **Technology Adoption**: Need for digital MRV systems to verify sustainability claims
- **Stranded Assets**: Conventional farming operations unable to meet new market requirements

**Financial Implications**:
- Traditional carbon offsets appear as financial liabilities on corporate balance sheets
- Supply chain disruptions create cost volatility and procurement risks
- Premium market opportunities exist but require verification systems
- Investment needed in regenerative transitions but farmers lack capital access
