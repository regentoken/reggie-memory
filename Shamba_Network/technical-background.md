# Shamba Network - Technical Background

## Scientific and Agricultural Basis

### Agricultural Research Foundation

**15-Year Research Background**: Founder Kennedy Ng'ang'a's extensive experience with International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) provides deep understanding of smallholder farming systems, yield improvement strategies, and sustainable agricultural practices.

**Smallholder Agriculture Challenges**: Traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple constraints including limited access to finance, climate risks, lack of data-driven decision making, and exclusion from global carbon markets.

**Regenerative Agriculture Science**: Focus on farming practices that restore soil health, increase biodiversity, enhance water retention, and sequester carbon while maintaining or improving agricultural productivity.

### Climate Science and Risk Assessment

**Climate Vulnerability**: African smallholder farmers are among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts, facing increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.

**Parametric Insurance Science**: Use of objective, measurable parameters (rainfall, temperature, vegetation indices) to trigger insurance payouts, eliminating need for traditional crop loss assessments.

**Early Warning Systems**: Satellite-based monitoring enables prediction of climate risks and proactive response rather than reactive disaster relief.

## Urgency and Scale of the Problem

### Climate Change Impacts on African Agriculture

**Food Security Crisis**: Climate change threatens food security for 400+ million people in sub-Saharan Africa who depend on rain-fed agriculture.

**Economic Vulnerability**: Agricultural losses from climate events can devastate rural communities with limited economic diversification options.

**Adaptation Gap**: Massive gap between climate adaptation needs and available financing, particularly for smallholder farmers.

### Carbon Market Exclusion

**Scale Barriers**: Traditional MRV costs ($20,000-$100,000+ per project) exclude small-scale agricultural carbon projects from participation in carbon markets.

**Methodological Gaps**: Lack of standardized methodologies for measuring and verifying carbon sequestration in smallholder agricultural systems.

**Financial Exclusion**: Limited access to global climate finance prevents smallholder farmers from monetizing their environmental stewardship.

## Climate-Related Risks and Financial Impact

### Agricultural Climate Risks

**Drought Impact**: Extended dry periods can cause complete crop failure, devastating farmer livelihoods and food security.

**Extreme Weather**: Floods, hailstorms, and extreme temperatures can destroy crops and livestock, creating immediate financial crises.

**Changing Patterns**: Shifting rainfall patterns and growing seasons disrupt traditional agricultural calendars and practices.

### Economic Risk Quantification

**Income Volatility**: Smallholder farmers face extreme income volatility due to climate risks, with potential for 50-100% income loss in bad years.

**Systemic Risk**: Climate risks affect entire regions simultaneously, overwhelming traditional insurance and support systems.

**Development Impact**: Agricultural losses perpetuate poverty cycles and limit investment in education, health, and productive assets.
