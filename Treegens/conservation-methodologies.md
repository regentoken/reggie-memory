# Treegens - Conservation Methodologies

## Field Techniques and Approaches

### Mangrove-Specific Restoration
Treegens specializes in mangrove restoration using scientifically-backed methodologies:

**Propagule Planting Technique:**
- Focus on mangrove propagules (seedlings) for optimal survival rates
- Strategic placement in appropriate tidal zones and soil conditions
- Consideration of local ecosystem factors and existing mangrove communities
- Timing of planting to align with optimal seasonal conditions

**Site Selection Methodology:**
- Assessment of coastal areas suitable for mangrove restoration
- Evaluation of soil salinity, tidal patterns, and existing vegetation
- Community consultation to ensure local support and land access
- GPS mapping and coordination verification to prevent duplicate claims

### AI-Enhanced Verification Protocol
Revolutionary approach combining technology with traditional conservation:

**Pre-Planting Documentation:**
- Video filming of area before tree planting to establish baseline
- GPS coordinate recording for precise location tracking
- Landmark identification for fraud prevention and verification
- Environmental condition assessment (soil, water, existing vegetation)

**Post-Planting Verification:**
- Immediate video documentation of planted trees
- AI tree counting with 97.5% accuracy rate
- Progressive monitoring every 6 months for 3 years
- Survival rate tracking and replanting protocols for failed trees

## Water and Coastal Restoration Strategies

### Mangrove Ecosystem Services
Treegens' focus on mangroves provides multiple restoration benefits:

**Water Quality Improvement:**
- Natural filtration of coastal waters through mangrove root systems
- Reduction of pollution and sedimentation in marine environments
- Support for fisheries and marine biodiversity
- Enhancement of water clarity and ecosystem health

**Coastal Protection:**
- Natural barriers against storm surge and coastal erosion
- Stabilization of shorelines through extensive root systems
- Reduction of flood risk for coastal communities
- Climate resilience building for vulnerable coastal areas

### Blue Carbon Focus
Emphasis on coastal carbon sequestration:
- Recognition of mangroves' superior carbon storage capacity (8-10x terrestrial forests)
- Long-term carbon sequestration in both biomass and sediments
- Integration with blue carbon credit markets
- Contribution to global climate change mitigation efforts

## Role of Local Communities

### Community-Centered Approach
