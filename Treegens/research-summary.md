# Treegens - Research Summary

## High-Level Project Overview

Treegens represents a groundbreaking integration of blockchain technology, AI verification, and community-driven reforestation focused on mangrove restoration. Founded by world record holder Jimi Cohen, the project has successfully planted over 1.8 million mangrove trees while pioneering the world's first dynamic semi-soulbound NFTs that evolve based on real-world regenerative impact.

The project distinguishes itself through its revolutionary "Proof of Tree" mechanism, requiring actual tree planting for token generation, and its comprehensive AI verification system achieving 97.5% accuracy. Treegens has successfully demonstrated the scalability of Web3-coordinated environmental action while creating sustainable economic incentives for global reforestation efforts.

## Key Research Findings

### Technological Innovation
- **Proof of Tree (PoT)**: Revolutionary protocol requiring actual mangrove planting for MGRO token minting, creating direct link between digital assets and real-world environmental impact
- **Dynamic Semi-Soulbound Tokens**: World's first NFTs that evolve visually based on verified regenerative actions, combining transferable artwork with non-transferable impact tracking
- **AI Verification System**: Proprietary tree counting technology achieving 97.5% accuracy, superior to human verification for large-scale operations
- **Multi-Layer Verification**: Combination of AI, GPS coordinates, community verification, and landmark identification for fraud prevention

### Environmental Impact
- **Superior Carbon Sequestration**: Focus on mangroves due to 8-10x greater carbon absorption compared to terrestrial forests
- **Comprehensive Ecosystem Services**: Water filtration, coastal protection, biodiversity habitat, and fisheries support
- **Proven Scale**: Over 1.8 million trees planted across multiple international locations
- **Long-term Monitoring**: 3-year verification protocol ensuring tree survival and ecosystem establishment

### Economic Model Innovation
- **Regenerative Economics**: Alignment of financial incentives with environmental restoration rather than extraction
- **Community Empowerment**: Direct payment to local tree planters creating sustainable livelihoods
- **Carbon Forwards**: Leveraging future carbon credit value for immediate funding of exponential tree planting
- **Transparent Impact**: Public verification of all claims through blockchain records and video documentation

### World Record Achievement
- **Individual Record**: Jimi Cohen's Guinness World Record of 30,000+ trees planted in 24 hours
- **Collective Goal**: Ambitious target to break Ethiopia's record of 350 million trees planted in 24 hours
- **Technology Enablement**: Platform designed to coordinate millions of global tree planters simultaneously
