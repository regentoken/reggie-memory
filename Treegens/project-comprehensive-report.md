# Treegens - Comprehensive Project Report

## Mission & Vision

Treegens' mission is to create a world where anyone can plant trees and earn a living through the most transparent and rewarding tree planting technology. The project aims to grow a movement of tree planters through innovative SocialFi and ReFi mechanisms, transitioning from "Degens to Regens" by making regenerative actions financially viable and engaging.

Their vision centers on exponential regeneration through advanced blockchain technology, AI verification, and gamification to coordinate tree planters worldwide. The ultimate goal is to beat the world record for most trees planted in 24 hours (currently 350 million trees set by Ethiopia) and scale to plant hundreds of millions of trees globally.
