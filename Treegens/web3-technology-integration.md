# Treegens - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Ecosystem

### TGN (Governance Token)
**Token:** TGN (TreeGen)  
**Utility:** Governance token for Treegens DAO with staking mechanisms  
**Blockchain:** Optimism Layer 2  

**Core Functions:**
- **DAO Governance**: TGN holders vote on strategic direction of Treegens
- **Proof of Plant Staking**: Stake TGN to become a verifier in the Proof of Plant protocol
- **Reward Distribution**: Stakers earn TGN rewards plus tokenized ecological credits
- **Verifier Compensation**: Verifiers receive 5% of MGRO tokens for validating tree planting claims

### MGRO (Mangrove Eco-Credit Token)
**Token:** MGRO (Mangrove)  
**Type:** Tokenized ecological credit  
**Value:** 1 MGRO = 1 mangrove tree grown for 3+ years  
**Minting Mechanism:** Proof of Tree (PoT) - only issued when mangrove trees are planted and verified

**Economic Model:**
- **Progressive Distribution**: 1/6th MGRO issued at planting, then 1/6th every 6 months for 3 years
- **Retirement Mechanism**: MGRO can be burned/retired to make ecological claims
- **Video Rewards**: Tree planting videos airdropped to those who burn MGRO tokens
- **Impact Verification**: Only minted after AI + DAO verification of actual tree planting

### FCBN Token (Planned)
**Token:** FCBN  
**Purpose:** Reward token for NFT community  
**Distribution:** Airdropped to Treegens NFT holders as incentive for tree planting contributions

## Blockchain Infrastructure

### Primary Network
**Blockchain:** Optimism (Layer 2 Ethereum)  
**Rationale:** Low transaction costs and energy efficiency for high-volume tree verification  
**Smart Contracts:** Management contracts for Dynamic Semi-Soulbound Tokens and verification protocols

### Technical Architecture
- **Carbon Negative Focus**: Built on energy-efficient proof-of-stake infrastructure
- **Scalable Verification**: Designed to handle millions of tree verification transactions
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with other ReFi protocols and carbon marketplaces

## Smart Contracts and DAO Structure

### Treegens DAO Governance
**Structure:** Decentralized Autonomous Organization with NFT-based voting  
**Decision Making:** Community voting on fund allocation and strategic direction  
**Treasury Management:** 50% of NFT mint goes to DAO treasury, 50% directly funds tree planting

### Dynamic Semi-Soulbound Tokens (DSST)
Revolutionary NFT technology with unique properties:

**Technical Features:**
- **Semi-Soulbound**: Base artwork is transferable, but impact orbs are non-transferable
- **Dynamic Visuals**: NFTs evolve based on real-world regenerative impact metrics
- **Dual Orb System**: 
  - Mind Orb: Brightens when funding trees (retiring MGRO)
  - Heart Orb: Brightens when planting trees (earning MGRO)
- **Profile Integration**: Orbs display on whichever Treegen NFT is used as profile picture

### Smart Contract Functions
- **Proof of Plant Verification**: Automated validation of tree planting claims
- **Token Distribution**: Progressive MGRO release over 3-year periods
- **Impact Tracking**: Real-time updating of NFT visuals based on verified actions
- **Fraud Prevention**: GPS coordinate checking and duplicate submission detection

## ReFi Mechanics and Economic Design

### Proof of Tree (PoT) Protocol
**Innovation:** Only way to mint MGRO tokens is to plant and verify mangrove trees  
**Verification Process:**
1. Plant mangrove trees in designated area
2. Film before/after footage for AI analysis
3. Submit GPS coordinates and planter profile
4. DAO members verify using AI-counted videos
5. MGRO tokens progressively distributed over 3 years

### Carbon Forwards Integration
**Strategy:** Leverage future carbon credit value for immediate tree funding  
**Mechanism:** Partner with impact investors to purchase carbon forwards  
**Benefit:** Exponential scaling of tree planting through reinvestment of future value

### Gamification and Incentives
- **Leaderboard System**: Web3 leaderboard gamifying trees funded and planted
- **Visual Evolution**: NFTs become more vibrant as holders increase impact
- **Community Rewards**: Verifiers earn percentage of all verified tree tokens
- **Achievement System**: Unlocking utility and perks through NFT leveling

## Decentralized Identity and Verification

### Verifier Network
**Role:** DAO members who stake TGN tokens to verify tree planting claims  
**Compensation:** 5% of all MGRO tokens distributed to verifiers  
**Responsibilities:** Review AI-counted videos, check GPS coordinates, validate planter profiles

### Anti-Fraud Mechanisms
- **GPS Verification**: Cross-referencing coordinates to prevent duplicate claims
- **Landmark Recognition**: AI identification of unique geographical features
- **Community Oversight**: Multiple verifiers review each submission
- **Reputation System**: Tracking of verifier accuracy and planter credibility

## Non-Fungible Updates (NFU) System

### Video Proof Integration
**Technology:** Integration with Livepeer for video processing and distribution  
**Function:** AI-counted tree videos brought on-chain as Non-Fungible Updates  
**Distribution:** Videos airdropped to MGRO token burners as proof of impact

### Real-World Integration
- **Documentary Evidence**: Every tree planting event captured and verified
- **Transparency**: Public access to video proof of all claimed impact
- **Community Engagement**: Supporters receive personalized videos of their funded trees

## Partnerships and Integrations

### ReFi Ecosystem Integration
- **KYOTO Protocol**: Layer 1 blockchain partnership for 4 million tree commitment
- **Multiple NFT Projects**: Integration with Ecosapiens, FightersGang, Greenstix, and others
- **Carbon Market Access**: Bluesphere Carbon partnership for impact investor connections

### Technical Collaborations
- **Livepeer**: Video processing and streaming for NFU system
- **AI Development**: Proprietary tree counting technology with 97.5% accuracy
- **Metaverse Integration**: Partnership with Metasphere Labs for virtual world integration

## Implementation Roadmap

### Current Status (Live)
- **TGN Governance Token**: Deployed and active for DAO governance
- **MGRO Eco-Credits**: Live minting through verified tree planting
- **DSST NFTs**: Dynamic NFTs responding to real-world impact
- **AI Verification**: 97.5% accurate tree counting system operational

### Near-Term Development
- **FCBN Token Launch**: Community reward token for NFT holders
- **Enhanced dApp**: Interactive globe with all Non-Fungible Updates displayed
- **Mobile Optimization**: Simplified mobile interface for tree planters in developing countries
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Expansion to additional blockchain networks

### Long-Term Vision
- **Global Coordination**: Platform capable of coordinating millions of tree planters
- **World Record Infrastructure**: Technology to support 350+ million trees in 24 hours
- **Mainstream Adoption**: Integration with traditional carbon markets and impact investing
- **Educational Platform**: Comprehensive Web3 onboarding for regenerators worldwide

## Measurement and Verification Technology

### Multi-Layer Verification Stack
1. **AI Tree Counting**: Computer vision analysis of planting videos
2. **Blockchain Recording**: Immutable storage of all verification data  
3. **Community Validation**: Human oversight through DAO verifier network
4. **Temporal Verification**: Ongoing monitoring every 6 months for 3 years
5. **Impact Tokenization**: Progressive MGRO distribution tied to verified survival

### Data Integration and Analytics
