# AquaSave - Conservation Methodologies

## Overview of Conservation Approach

AquaSave employs a **technology-enabled community participation model** for water conservation, combining IoT monitoring devices with blockchain incentives to create a decentralized network for water resource protection. The approach focuses on empowering individuals and communities to become active stewards of water resources while generating valuable data for broader conservation efforts.
