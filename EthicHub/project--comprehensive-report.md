## Operational Model

### Crowdlending Mechanism
EthicHub operates a crowd-lending platform where global investors pool funds to provide affordable loans to smallholder farmers, using blockchain technology and smart contracts to ensure transparency and automate processes.

### Value Creation Framework
The platform creates mutual benefit by enabling lenders to provide affordable loans to farmers while direct buyers (coffee roasters) offer fair prices for crops, creating a sustainable cycle that helps farmers escape poverty and low productivity.

### Risk Management
The innovative "crowd-collateral" system (Blended Finance on smart contracts) provides collateral for traditionally uncollateralized loans, making lending to smallholder farmers viable while minimizing risk for investors.

### Impact Integration
All operations align with UN Sustainable Development Goals, with detailed reporting on measurable contributions to global development objectives while maintaining financial sustainability for all participants.
