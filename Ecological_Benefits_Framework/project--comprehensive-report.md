# Ecological Benefits Framework - Comprehensive Report

## Mission & Vision

The Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) represents a transformative initiative designed to radically transform global carbon and ecological benefits markets by creating a unified framework for measuring, valuing, and trading environmental benefits beyond carbon. The mission centers on developing a foundational architecture that increases transparency, trust, quality, and equity while accelerating coordinated delivery of positive financial and environmental impacts.

The vision encompasses moving beyond "carbon tunnel vision" to create holistic approaches that tackle biodiversity loss, growing inequality, water scarcity, air pollution, and soil degradation through a comprehensive framework built around six key areas: Air, Water, Soil, Biodiversity, Equity, and Carbon. This framework aims to align public and private sectors to support rapid deployment of strategic capital for activities that create measurable, life-affirming ecological impacts.

## Legal & Organizational Structure

The Ecological Benefits Framework operates as a program of The Lexicon, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization based in California. The EBF represents an unprecedented collaboration between diverse stakeholders rather than a traditional corporate structure.

**Organizational Model**: Multi-stakeholder collaboration involving climate experts, Web3 and blockchain technologists, carbon registries, standards organizations, environmentalists, academics, impact investors, and the ReFi community.

**Partnership Structure**: Joint initiative between ReFi DAO and The Lexicon known as "ReFi EBF" that integrates the framework within regenerative finance and Web3 ecosystems.

**Funding Mechanism**: Supported through philanthropic grants from organizations including Ripple and BxC, as well as community funding through Gitcoin Grants and other public goods funding mechanisms.
