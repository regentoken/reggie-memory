# Ecological Benefits Framework - Web3 Technology Integration

## Token Status & Details

**Token: Not Currently Implemented**
The EBF operates as a framework and standard rather than having a native token. However, the framework is designed to integrate with various tokenized environmental assets and Web3 applications.

**ReFi EBF Integration**: Partnership with ReFi DAO enables integration with various Web3 protocols and tokenized environmental assets.

## Blockchain Integration

### Framework Implementation
**Smart Contract Standards**: Development of smart contract templates that implement EBF measurement and verification standards.

**Automated Verification**: Integration with monitoring systems that automatically verify environmental performance across all six EBF pillars.

**Standardized Metadata**: Blockchain-based metadata standards that enable consistent representation of environmental benefits across different protocols.

### DeFi Integration
**Environmental Asset Pooling**: Framework enables creation of diversified environmental asset pools that include multiple benefit types.

**Yield Generation**: Integration with DeFi protocols that generate yield from diversified environmental benefit portfolios.

**Impact Bonds**: Development of impact bonds and other financial instruments based on comprehensive environmental assessment.
