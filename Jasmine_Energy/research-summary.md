# Jasmine Energy - Research Summary

## High-Level Summary of Findings

Jasmine Energy represents a significant innovation in the renewable energy certificate (REC) market, applying blockchain technology to solve critical inefficiencies in a $10 billion annual market. Led by CEO Nathalie Capati, a Forbes 30 Under 30 awardee, the Y Combinator-backed company has developed a decentralized platform that transforms renewable energy certificate trading from a slow, opaque process into a transparent, liquid marketplace.

### Core Value Proposition
The platform addresses fundamental problems in traditional REC markets including weeks-long registration processes, days-long transaction settlement, limited transparency, and high barriers to entry for small-scale generators. By tokenizing energy attribute certificates as EATs (Energy Attribute Tokens) on blockchain, Jasmine Energy reduces transaction times from days to seconds while enabling fractional trading and real-time verification.

### Technology Innovation
Built on Polygon blockchain with plans for multi-chain expansion, the Jasmine Bridge protocol enables bidirectional conversion between traditional RECs and blockchain-based tokens. This preserves existing regulatory compliance while unlocking new capabilities including DeFi integration, automated settlement, and programmable environmental attribute management.

### Market Impact Potential
With 5,000+ pre-launch members including Fortune 500 companies and partnerships with major blockchain protocols like Sei Network and Dione Protocol, Jasmine Energy is positioned to significantly increase renewable energy market participation and liquidity, ultimately accelerating grid decarbonization through improved economics for clean energy generators.
