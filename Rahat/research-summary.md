# Rahat - Research Summary

## High-Level Project Overview

Rahat represents a groundbreaking implementation of blockchain technology for humanitarian aid distribution, developed by the women-led team at Rumsan (formerly eSatya) in Nepal. The platform addresses critical inefficiencies in traditional humanitarian aid systems by leveraging mobile-based blockchain tokens to create faster, more transparent, and more dignified aid distribution processes. 

Named "Rahat" (meaning "relief" in Nepali), the project has successfully demonstrated its approach through multiple pilot programs, supporting 220+ families during COVID-19 response and expanding internationally through partnerships with UNICEF, Danish Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations. As an open-source Digital Public Good (DPG), Rahat is positioned for global scaling across vulnerable communities worldwide.

## Key Findings Summary

**Humanitarian Innovation**: Rahat successfully transforms traditional Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) by reducing distribution time from months to hours while maintaining transparency and accountability through blockchain technology.

**Technology for Social Impact**: The platform demonstrates effective integration of blockchain with humanitarian principles, prioritizing accessibility and dignity over technological complexity through mobile-first design and community-based implementation.

**Gender Leadership**: Led by women in technology, including co-founder Rumee Singh (recognized as one of 10 women changing the face of technology in Nepal), Rahat demonstrates gender equality in blockchain development and humanitarian technology leadership.

**Community Empowerment**: The platform successfully integrates with local vendor networks and traditional authority structures, creating economic multiplier effects while building financial resilience in vulnerable communities.

**Global Recognition**: UNICEF Innovation Fund investment of $100,000 and recognition as a Digital Public Good validates the platform's potential for international scaling and humanitarian sector transformation.
